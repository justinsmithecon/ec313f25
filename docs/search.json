    "text": "Course Description\nThis course examines the economics of taxation through both theoretical and empirical lenses. Using tools from microeconomics and econometrics, we analyze how different forms of taxation affect individual behavior, economic efficiency, and the distribution of resources. The course introduces key concepts in tax incidence, optimal taxation, pigouvian taxes, and the trade-offs between equity and efficiency. Students will engage with current research to understand how economists estimate the behavioral and welfare effects of tax policy. They are also asked to apply their knowledge to data based assignments. While the course is centered on the Canadian tax system, the main concepts are applicable more widely. By the end of the course, students will be equipped to critically assess tax policy using the theoretical and empirical techniques in public economics."

Timeslots are 15-mins each, and you can book up to two for each office hours session depending on how much you need to discuss. When you book, the system will automatically enter a time into my calendar, and it will stay there unless you cancel. It also produces reminder emails to make sure neither of us forgets."

The university has a site licence for this software, which you can access from the in-person or virtual computer labs. To access the virtual labs, follow the instructions outlined here\nhttps://students.wlu.ca/services-and-spaces/tech-services/computers-and-equipment/virtual-computer-labs.html\nIf you would like to purchase a copy of Stata for home use (not required), there are various options you can explore here: https://www.stata.com/order/dl/. The cheapest option is student license for Stata/BE, which costs USD 49.\n\n\nCourse GPT\nI have created a GPT specific to this course that you can use if you wish, linked here. While my opinion is that the best way to succeed in this course is to engage with the lectures, lecture notes, textbook, and to ask questions in office hours, I recognize that people will use AI. To make the AI experience as closely linked to EC313 as possible, I have trained a GPT on some of the course materials.\nYou are permitted to use generative AI for your assignments. In all submissions in which you use generative AI, you must cite its usage. Failing to cite the use of generative AI is a form of academic misconduct and Senate Policy 12.2 Student Code of Conduct: Academic Misconduct will be applied. Treat the AI as you would any other source, meaning that you cannot directly copy and paste AI output into your assignments.\nUse this tool with caution. As we all know, generative AI does not always produce reliable output, and as such you may get wrong answers to your questions even though it is trained on the course material."

The midterm will take place in the classroom where the lectures take place at the scheduled lecture time. The final exam schedule is posted roughly half way through the term.\nIn the past I have placed more weight on the assignments and less weight on the in-person exams, but the pervasive use of generative AI has made it impossible to verify that assessments done outside of the classroom were actually completed by the student. So while take-home assignments are still part of the course, they do not constitute a large proportion of the grade."
