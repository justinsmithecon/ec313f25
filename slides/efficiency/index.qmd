# Goals of This Section

## Goals of This Section

-   Outline different types of taxes

-   Discuss different between statutory and economic incidence of a tax

-   Show how tax incidence depends on elasticities of supply and demand

-   Expand on tax incidence in various markets

# Excess Burden of a Tax with Indifference Curves

## Introduction

-   Governments levy taxes mainly to raise revenue to fund public goods and services

-   Taxes can impose different types of costs on consumers

    -   The direct cost of sending money to the government

    -   Taxes can distort behaviour because of changes in prices

        -   Without taxes consumers make choices about consumption
        -   Taxes force them to substitute away from the taxed good and make sub-optimal choices

-   Ideally a tax imposes the least possible cost in order to raise revenue

    -   When the costs are larger, we say there is an excess burden

## Ad Valorem Tax on Consumers

- Below we will see what happens when an ad valorem tax is imposed on one good

    -   An ad valorem tax is a percentage tax on the price of a good

    -   For example, a 10% sales tax on a \$1 item means the consumer pays \$1.10
    
- We will use indifference curves and budget constraints to analyze the effects of the tax

- We will then compare to a lump-sum tax

- Lesson is that ad valorem taxes that distort behaviour create excess burden

- Lump-sum taxes that do not distort behaviour do not create excess burden

- Difference due to the distortionary effect of changing relative prices with ad valorem taxes

-   Graph shows consumption decision for barley and corn

-   Initially prices are $P_{B}$ and $P_{C}$

-   Budget constraint is $I = P_{B}B + P_{C}C$

-   To plot budget constraint, put $C$ on left side

$$C = \frac{I}{P_{C}} - \frac{P_{B}}{P_{C}}B$$

-   Slope of budget constraint is $-\frac{P_{B}}{P_{C}}$

-   Intercepts are $\frac{I}{P_{C}}$ and $\frac{I}{P_{B}}$

-   Optimal consumption bundle is $B_1$ and $C_1$

-   An ad valorem tax of $t$ on barley is imposed

-   Price of barley rises to $P_{B}(1+t)$

-   New budget constraint is $I = P_{B}(1+t)B + P_{C}C$

-   Rearranging gives

$$C = \frac{I}{P_{C}} - \frac{P_{B}(1+t)}{P_{C}}B$$

-   Slope of new budget constraint is $-\frac{P_{B}(1+t)}{P_{C}}$

-   Intercepts are $\frac{I}{P_{C}}$ and $\frac{I}{P_{B}(1+t)}$

-   New optimal bundle is $B_2$ and $C_2$

-   Vertical distance between budget lines is tax collected

-   On the old budget line if consumer buys $B_2$ barley, corn consumption is

$$C^{'} = \frac{I}{P_{C}} - \frac{P_{B}}{P_{C}}B_2$$

-   On the new budget line if consumer buys $B_2$ barley, corn consumption is

$$C_{2} = \frac{I}{P_{C}} - \frac{P_{B}(1+t)}{P_{C}}B_2$$

-   Difference is

$$C^{'} - C_{2} = \frac{P_{B}t}{P_{C}}B_2$$

-   Measures reduction in corn consumption due to tax

-   To measure in dollar terms

$$P_{C}(C^{'} - C_{2}) = tP_{B}B_2$$

-   This is the tax rate times the value of barley consumed

-   As a comparison, consider leaving prices unchanged and reducing income to reach the same utility as we got with the tax

    -   This income reduction is the **equivalent variation**

-   Shift the original budget line parallel in until it is tangent to the new indifference curve

-   Distance between the original and new budget lines is the equivalent variation

-   The **excess burden** of a tax is the loss in welfare beyond the tax revenue collected

-   In the graph it is the difference between the equivalent variation and the tax revenue collected

    -   Equivalent variation measures loss in welfare
        -   Distance in green
    -   Tax revenue is money collected by government
        -   Distance between black and red budget lines

-   In this case, equivalent variation is larger than tax revenue

    -   So there is a positive excess burden (in purple)

## Excess Burden

-   An ad valorem tax on one good creates two effects

    1.  Income effect: consumer is poorer, so consumes less of all normal goods

    2.  Substitution effect: relative price of taxed good rises, so consumer substitutes away from taxed good

-   Excess burden arises because of the substitution effect

    -   Consumer substitutes away from taxed good to other goods

    -   This leads to a loss in welfare beyond the tax revenue collected

-   One way to see this is to compare an ad valorem tax to a lump-sum tax

    -   Lump-sum tax only has income effect, no substitution effect

    -   So no excess burden

# Lump Sum Tax

-   A lump-sum tax $T$ is imposed

-   New budget constraint is $I -T = P_{B}(1+t)B + P_{C}C$

-   Rearranging gives

$$C = \frac{I-T}{P_{C}} - \frac{P_{B}(1+t)}{P_{C}}B$$

-   Budget line shifts down in parallel by $T$

    -   Prices do not change, so slope does not either

-   New optimal bundle is $B_3$ and $C_3$
:::
::::::

# Lump Sum Tax

:::::: columns
:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {layout="[[-1], [1], [-1]]"}
![](images/clipboard-1570277999.png)
:::
::::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Tax revenue is $T$

    -   Does not depend on how much of each good is consumed

-   Equivalent variation is also $T$

    -   Distance between original and new budget lines is $T$

-   So there is no excess burden

    -   Welfare loss equals tax revenue collected

-   Arises because a lump sum tax is a pure income effect

    -   No substitution effect, so no excess burden
:::

# Challenges with Excess Burden

## Efficiency

- If lump sum taxes do not create excess burden, why not use them?

- Often they are unattractive politically

    - A fixed tax on everyone is viewed as unfair
    
    - It is also regressive

- There are few examples in the world

  - UK had a poll (head) tax in the late 80s that was unpopular
  - Some municipal government charge fixed fees for licenses/permits
  
- So governments widely use distortionary taxes instead

## Income taxes

- Income taxes can also involve excess burdens

- Income taxes distort labour supply decisions

    -   Higher tax rates reduce the after-tax wage

    -   This causes people to substitute away from labour towards leisure
    
    -   This is a substitution effect that creates excess burden
    
- Like with goods, income taxes change relative prices, and therefore behaviour

-   Changes the price of leisure relative to consumption
