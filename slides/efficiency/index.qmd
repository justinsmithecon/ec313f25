# Excess Burden of a Tax with Indifference Curves

## Introduction

-   Governments levy taxes mainly to raise revenue to fund public goods and services

-   Taxes can impose different types of costs on consumers

    -   The direct cost of sending money to the government

    -   Taxes can distort behaviour because of changes in prices

        -   Without taxes consumers make choices about consumption
        -   Taxes force them to substitute away from the taxed good and make sub-optimal choices

-   Ideally a tax imposes the least possible cost in order to raise revenue

    -   When the costs are larger, we say there is an excess burden

## Ad Valorem Tax on Consumers

-   Below we will see what happens when an ad valorem tax is imposed on one good

    -   An ad valorem tax is a percentage tax on the price of a good

    -   For example, a 10% sales tax on a \$1 item means the consumer pays \$1.10

-   We will use indifference curves and budget constraints to analyze the effects of the tax

-   We will then compare to a lump-sum tax

-   Lesson is that ad valorem taxes that distort behaviour create excess burden

-   Lump-sum taxes that do not distort behaviour do not create excess burden

-   Difference due to the distortionary effect of changing relative prices with ad valorem taxes

-   Graph shows consumption decision for barley and corn

-   Initially prices are $P_{B}$ and $P_{C}$

-   Budget constraint is $I = P_{B}B + P_{C}C$

-   To plot budget constraint, put $C$ on left side

$$C = \frac{I}{P_{C}} - \frac{P_{B}}{P_{C}}B$$

-   Slope of budget constraint is $-\frac{P_{B}}{P_{C}}$

-   Intercepts are $\frac{I}{P_{C}}$ and $\frac{I}{P_{B}}$

-   An ad valorem tax of $t$ on barley is imposed

-   Vertical distance between budget lines is tax collected

-   On the old budget line if consumer buys $B_2$ barley, corn consumption is

$$C^{'} = \frac{I}{P_{C}} - \frac{P_{B}}{P_{C}}B_2$$

-   On the new budget line if consumer buys $B_2$ barley, corn consumption is

$$C_{2} = \frac{I}{P_{C}} - \frac{P_{B}(1+t)}{P_{C}}B_2$$

-   Difference is

-   Measures reduction in corn consumption due to tax

-   To measure in dollar terms

$$P_{C}(C^{'} - C_{2}) = tP_{B}B_2$$

-   This is the tax rate times the value of barley consumed

-   As a comparison, consider leaving prices unchanged and reducing income to reach the same utility as we got with the tax

    -   This income reduction is the **equivalent variation**

-   Shift the original budget line parallel in until it is tangent to the new indifference curve

-   Distance between the original and new budget lines is the equivalent variation

-   The **excess burden** of a tax is the loss in welfare beyond the tax revenue collected

-   In the graph it is the difference between the equivalent variation and the tax revenue collected

    -   Equivalent variation measures loss in welfare
        -   Distance in green
    -   Tax revenue is money collected by government
        -   Distance between black and red budget lines

-   In this case, equivalent variation is larger than tax revenue

    -   So there is a positive excess burden (in purple)
:::
::::::

## Excess Burden

-   An ad valorem tax on one good creates two effects

    1.  Income effect: consumer is poorer, so consumes less of all normal goods

    2.  Substitution effect: relative price of taxed good rises, so consumer substitutes away from taxed good

-   Excess burden arises because of the substitution effect

    -   Consumer substitutes away from taxed good to other goods

    -   This leads to a loss in welfare beyond the tax revenue collected

-   One way to see this is to compare an ad valorem tax to a lump-sum tax

    -   Lump-sum tax only has income effect, no substitution effect

    -   So no excess burden

# Lump Sum Tax

-   A lump-sum tax $T$ is imposed

-   New budget constraint is $I -T = P_{B}(1+t)B + P_{C}C$

-   Rearranging gives

$$C = \frac{I-T}{P_{C}} - \frac{P_{B}(1+t)}{P_{C}}B$$

-   Budget line shifts down in parallel by $T$

    -   Prices do not change, so slope does not either

-   New optimal bundle is $B_3$ and $C_3$
:::
::::::

# Lump Sum Tax

![](images/clipboard-1570277999.png)
:::
::::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Tax revenue is $T$

    -   Does not depend on how much of each good is consumed

-   Equivalent variation is also $T$

    -   Distance between original and new budget lines is $T$

-   So there is no excess burden

    -   Welfare loss equals tax revenue collected

-   Arises because a lump sum tax is a pure income effect

    -   No substitution effect, so no excess burden
:::
::::::

# Challenges with Excess Burden

## Efficiency

-   If lump sum taxes do not create excess burden, why not use them?

-   Often they are unattractive politically

    -   A fixed tax on everyone is viewed as unfair

    -   It is also regressive

-   There are few examples in the world

    -   UK had a poll (head) tax in the late 80s that was unpopular
    -   Some municipal government charge fixed fees for licenses/permits

-   So governments widely use distortionary taxes instead

## Income taxes

-   Income taxes can also involve excess burdens

-   Income taxes distort labour supply decisions

    -   Higher tax rates reduce the after-tax wage

    -   This causes people to substitute away from labour towards leisure

    -   This is a substitution effect that creates excess burden

-   Like with goods, income taxes change relative prices, and therefore behaviour

-   Changes the price of leisure relative to consumption

## Excess Burden with Inelastic Demand

-   Suppose that a tax is introduced on barley, but barley consumption does not change

-   Does this mean there is no excess burden?

-   Answer: no

    -   Consumer faces different relative prices

    -   These distort the consumer's choices

    -   This leads to inefficiency, and excess burden

## Excess Burden with Inelastic Demand

:::
::::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Graph looks similar to before

-   This time barley consumption stays constant

-   Corn consumption rises due to relatively lower price

-   Excess burden is about the change in the consumption *bundle*

    -   Not just the change in quantity of one good
:::
::::::

# Excess Burden with Demand Curves

## Aside: Compensated vs Ordinary Demand Curves

-   A demand curve measures the change in quantity demanded as price changes

-   **Ordinary (Marshallian) demand curve**: measures the total change in quantity demanded as price changes

    -   Includes both income and substitution effects

-   **Compensated (Hicksian) demand curve**: measures the change in quantity demanded as price changes, holding utility constant

    -   Only includes substitution effect
    -   Can hold utility constant at initial level or new level

-   Excess burden is related to the substitution effect, so we use compensated demand curves

## Aside: Compensated vs Ordinary Demand Curves

![](images/clipboard-567879067.png)
:::
::::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Consider a tax on barley

    -   Price of barley rises from $P_{B}$ to $P_{B}(1+t)$

-   The ordinary demand curve measures change from old equilibrium at old prices to new equilibrium at new prices

    -   Includes both income and substitution effects

-   The compensated demand curve measures starts from new utility curve at old prices then new equilibrium at new prices

    -   Only includes substitution effect

-   The drop in demand is larger for ordinary demand
:::
::::::

::: {layout="[[-1], [1], [-1]]"}
![](images/clipboard-1841143221.png)
:::
::::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Demand curve is plot of price vs quantity demanded

-   On left we plot price before and after tax against quantities

-   Drop in quantity is larger for ordinary demand curve

    -   Includes both income and substitution effects
    -   So ordinary demand curve is flatter

-   Compensated demand curve is steeper because it only includes substitution effect
:::
::::::

## Excess Burden with Demand Curves

-   Excess burden of a tax is related to the substitution effect

-   We can use compensated demand curve to measure it

-   Recall that it is loss in welfare beyond tax revenue collected

-   The loss in welfare to the consumer is measured by the drop in consumer surplus

    -   This is the area under the compensated demand curve between old and new prices

-   Part of that loss is tax revenue collected

    -   This is the rectangle with height equal to the tax and width equal to new quantity

-   The other part is lost entirely to the consumer

    -   This is the excess burden

-   Imagine a tax is imposed on barley

-   Supply is perfectly elastic

    -   So economic incidence falls entirely on consumers

-   Price rises from $P_{B}$ to $P_{B}(1+t)$

-   Compensated quantity demanded falls from $B_{3}$ to $B_{2}$

-   Tax revenue is green rectangle

-   Total fall in consumer surplus is green + blue areas

-   Excess burden is blue area
:::

# Excess Burden with Elasticities

-   We can translate the excess burden area into a formula using elasticities

-   The excess burden is the blue triangle

-   Area of triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}$

    -   Base is change in quantity: $\Delta B = B_{3} - B_{2}$

    -   Height is tax: $tP_{b}$

-   The definition of elasticity at the original equilibrium is

$$\eta = \frac{\Delta B}{\Delta P} \times \frac{P_b}{B_3}$$

# Excess Burden with Elasticities

-   Rearranging gives

$$\Delta B = \eta \times \frac{\Delta P}{P_b} \times B_3$$

-   In our case, $\Delta P = tP_{b}$, so

$$\Delta B = \eta \times t \times B_{3}$$

-   The area is then

$$\text{Excess Burden} = \frac{1}{2} \times (\eta \times t \times B_{3}) \times (tP_{b}) = \frac{1}{2} \times (\eta\times B_{3}) \times (t^2 P_{b}) $$

# Excess Burden with Elasticities

-   Some insights with the formula

$$\text{Excess Burden} = \frac{1}{2} \times (\eta\times B_{3}) \times (t^2 P_{b}) $$

-   Excess burden depends on three things

    1.  Size of tax $t$

        -   Excess burden rises with square of tax rate

    2.  Elasticity of demand $\eta$

        -   More elastic demand means larger excess burden

    3.  Initial spending $P_{b}B_{3}$

        -   Larger initial spending means larger excess burden

# Additional Considerations for Excess Burden

## Pre-existing Distortions

-   In the real world, there are many taxes and regulations that distort behaviour

-   If a new tax is introduced, it may interact with these pre-existing distortions

    -   Pre-existing distortions include monopoly power, externalities, and other taxes

-   Having pre-existing distortions complicates the analysis of excess burden

    -   A new tax may increase or decrease overall excess burden

    -   Depends on how it interacts with pre-existing distortions

-   **Theory of the Second Best**: If economic optimum cannot be achieved (due to existing distortions), the next best solution may involve introducing additional distortions

## Pre-existing Distortions

-   Example 1: pre-existing tax on good A

    -   This tax distorts consumption away from good A

    -   Introducing a tax on good B may lead consumers to substitute towards good A

    -   This can reduce the excess burden on good A by increasing its consumption

    -   Overall excess burden may increase or decrease because of the new tax on good B

## Pre-existing Distortions

-   Example 2: Minimum Wages

    -   A labour market monopsony leads to lower wages and employment than in a competitive market

    -   Imposing a minimum wage can increase employment and reduce the excess burden caused by monopsony power

-   Example 3: Externalities from Carbon

    -   A country has a negative externality from emissions and cannot impose a carbon tax

    -   The next best outcome might involve subsidies for renewable energy, even if they distort energy markets

-   General lesson is that impact of tax is not limited to the market it directly affects

    -   Overall excess burden depends on interactions with other markets and distortions

## Excess Burden of a Subsidy

-   A subsidy is a negative tax

    -   It lowers the price paid by consumers or received by producers

-   Problem is that it can lead to over-consumption or over-production

    -   This creates inefficiencies and excess burden

-   A subsidy will increase welfare (consumer surplus) but the cost to the government may exceed this increase

    -   The difference is the excess burden of the subsidy

-   Picture a housing subsidy

-   Prior to subsidy, optimal consumption is $H_0$ at price $P_h$

-   Subsidy lowers price to $(1-s)P_h$

-   New optimal consumption is $H_1$

-   Cost of subsidy is green plus blue rectangle

-   Increase in consumer surplus is green area

-   Excess burden is blue triangle

## Excess Burden of Income Tax

-   Income taxes distort labour supply decisions

    -   Higher tax rates reduce the after-tax wage

    -   This causes people to substitute away from labour towards leisure

    -   This is a substitution effect that creates excess burden

## Excess Burden of Income Tax

-   Imagine a labour market with elastic labour demand

    -   So a tax on labour is borne entirely by workers

-   An income tax shifts down labour demand curve from $D_0$ to $D_1$

    -   Reduces wage from $W_$ to $(1-t)W$

-   Initially worker surplus is area below demand curve and above supply

-   After tax, surplus falls by yellow plus green areas

-   Some of the fall is collected by government as tax revenue

    -   This is yellow rectangle

-   The green triangle is lost entirely

    -   This is the excess burden
    
- Result is very similar to excess burden from a tax on goods

    - Except here the tax is on wages and workers are suppliers
:::
::::::


## Excess Burden of Income Tax

-   The formula for excess burden is similar to that for goods

$$\text{Excess Burden} = \frac{1}{2} \times (\epsilon \times L_{0}) \times (t^2 W) $$

-  Where $\epsilon$ is the elasticity of labour supply

-   Excess burden depends on 

    1.  Size of tax $t$

        -   Excess burden rises with square of tax rate

    2.  Elasticity of labour supply $\epsilon$

        -   More elastic labour supply means larger excess burden

    3.  Initial earnings $WL_{0}$

        -   Larger initial earnings means larger excess burden
