# Goals of This Section

## Goals of This Section

-   Outline different types of taxes

-   Discuss different between statutory and economic incidence of a tax

-   Show how tax incidence depends on elasticities of supply and demand

-   Expand on tax incidence in various markets

# Types of Taxes

## Introduction

-   There are many different types of taxes

-   Taxes can have different goals

    -   Raise revenue for government spending
    -   Change behaviour of individuals or firms
    -   Redistribute resources

-   They can also have different bases, structures, and rates

    -   Base: what is being taxed (e.g. income, consumption, property)
    -   Structure: how the tax is applied (e.g. progressive, regressive, flat)
    -   Rate: how much is being taxed (e.g. percentage, fixed amount)

-   Below we cover some of the most common types of taxes

## Taxes on Income

-   **Income Tax**: tax on income earned during the year

-   Can be levied on individuals or corporations

-   For individuals, includes but not limited to

    -   Labour market earnings
    -   Capital gains
    -   Investment income (e.g. from dividends, interest, property)
    -   Pensions and retirement income (e.g. RRSPs)
    -   Some government benefits (e.g. employment insurance)
    -   Other taxable benefits (e.g. premiums paid by employer for group life insurance)

## Taxes on Income

-   For corporations, includes but not limited to

    -   Active business income from sales or goods and services
    -   Investment income
    -   Capital gains
    -   Some government grants
    -   Depends on the size of your business
        -   Small business pay a lower rate

## Payroll Taxes

-   **Payroll Taxes**: taxes levied on employment income

    -   Paid by both employers and employees

-   Used to finance social insurance and public pension programs

    -   Examples: Employment Insurance (EI), Canada Pension Plan (CPP), worker compensation

-   Payroll taxes vary by province

    -   Some charge a health tax (e.g. BC Employer Health Tax)
    -   Manitoba charges a levy for health and postsecondary education

-   These are different from the general income tax

## Consumption Taxes

-   **Consumption Tax**: a tax paid on consumption of goods and services

-   Taxes generally charged by a seller at point of sale

    -   They remit these funds to the government

-   Examples:

    -   Sales tax (e.g. GST, HST, PST)
    -   Excise taxes (e.g. gasoline, alcohol, tobacco)
    -   Tariffs (tax on imports)

## Wealth Taxes

-   **Wealth Taxes**: taxes on the value of an asset

-   Typical wealth taxes include

    -   Property tax (tax on value of land/buildings)
    -   Estate tax (tax on value of estate at death)
    -   General wealth tax (tax on total value of assets owned)

-   Estate taxes and general wealth taxes are not used in Canada

-   Property taxes are a major source of revenue for municipal governments

# Statutory vs Economic Incidence of a Tax

## Introduction

-   The question of who "pays" a tax is more complicated than it seems

-   Example: in Canada, there is a federal \$0.10/litre tax on gasoline

    -   Gasoline stations include this in their price
    -   They remit the tax to the government
    -   Does the seller or the consumer pay?

-   This section will clarify who pays a tax

-   Separate between **statutory** and **economic** incidence of a tax

-   My view: this is the most important concept we teach in this program

## Statutory vs Economic Incidence of a Tax

-   **Statutory Incidence**: who is legally responsible for paying the tax to the government

    -   In the gasoline tax example, the statutory incidence is on the gasoline station

        -   They send a cheque to the government

-   **Economic Incidence**: the change in real income brought about by the tax

    -   In the gasoline tax example, the economic incidence can be shared between the gasoline station and the consumer

        -   The gasoline station may less revenue per litre sold
        -   The consumer may pay a higher price per litre purchased

## Statutory vs Economic Incidence of a Tax

-   Example: \$0.10/litre tax on gasoline

    -   Before tax is imposed, suppose price is \$1.00/litre

        -   Consumers pay \$1.00/litre, gas station receives \$1.00/litre

    -   Then government levies \$0.10/litre tax on gasoline station

        -   Suppose gasoline station raises price to \$1.10/litre
        -   Consumer pays \$1.10/litre
        -   Gas station keeps \$1.00/litre, remits \$0.10/litre to government

    -   In this case, the consumer bears the entire economic incidence of the tax

        -   Gasoline station receives same revenue per litre as before tax
        -   Consumer pays \$0.10/litre more than before tax

## Statutory vs Economic Incidence of a Tax

-   Example 2: \$0.10/litre tax on gasoline

    -   Same \$0.10/litre tax on gas station

        -   Suppose gas station raises price to \$1.05/litre
        -   Consumer pays \$1.05/litre
        -   Gas station keeps \$0.95/litre, remits \$0.10/litre to government

    -   In this case, the consumer and gas station share the economic incidence of the tax

        -   Gas station receives \$0.05/litre less than before tax
        -   Consumer pays \$0.05/litre more than before tax

## Statutory vs Economic Incidence of a Tax

-   Key lesson is that **statutory incidence does not determine economic incidence**

    -   In example, statutory incidence is always on the gas station
    -   Economic incidence depends on how much of the tax is passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices
    -   Gas station could pass on all, some, or none of the tax to consumers

-   Statutory incidence says nothing about economic incidence

-   To determine economic incidence, we need to look at underlying economic forces

-   Take gasoline tax example one more time

-   On right is demand and supply of litres of gasoline

-   Without tax, price and quantity are determined where demand and supply are equal

    -   Price is $P_{0}$

    -   Quantity is $Q_{0}$

-   Now government levies a per unit tax $t$ (e.g. \$0.10/litre) on gasoline

-   Tax is levied on **sellers** (statutory incidence)

-   This shifts the supply curve up by the amount of the tax

    -   New supply curve is $S'$
    -   At each quantity, sellers want to charge $t$ more to cover the tax

-   New equilibrium is where $S'$ intersects $D$

    -   Determines price paid by consumers

-   The tax introduces a **tax wedge**

    -   Difference between what consumers pay and what producers receive from a transaction

-   Consumers pay the equilibrium price $P_{c}'$

    -   Price includes the tax

-   Producers receive $P_{s}' = P_{c}' - t$

    -   They remit $t$ for every unit sold

-   Quantity falls to $Q'_{1}$
:::
::::::

## Unit Tax on Sellers - Graphical

-   In example above, economic incidence is shared equally between consumers and producers

    -   Consumers pay $P_{c}' - P_{0}$ more than before tax
    -   Producers receive $P_{0} - P_{s}'$ less than before tax
    -   These amounts are equal

-   Equal economic incidence is specific to this example because supply and demand have the same slope

-   In general, **economic incidence depends on the elasticities of supply and demand**

    -   A more elastic demand curve means consumers bear less of the economic incidence

        -   Higher elasticity means consumers can switch to other goods when price changes

    -   A more elastic supply curve means producers bear less of the economic incidence

        -   A firm with higher elasticity can alter production easily when prices change

-   Graph to the right shows a more inelastic demand curve

-   After tax consumers pay $P_{c}'$

-   Producers receive $P_{s}' = P_{c}' - t$

-   But $P_{c}' - P_{0}$ is now larger than $P_{0} - P_{s}'$

    -   Inelastic demand means consumers less able to substitute

    -   They absorb more of the economic incidence

-   In extreme with perfectly inelastic demand, consumers bear entire economic incidence

    -   Perfect inelastic demand means complete inability to substitute

-   After tax consumers pay $P_{c}' = P_{0} + t$

-   Producers receive $P_{s}' = P_{c}' - t = P_{0}$

-   No change in quantity

    -   Since consumers demand $Q_{0} = Q'_{1}$ at any price

-   Now imagine a more inelastic supply curve

    -   Firms less able to adjust quantities when prices change

-   After tax consumers pay $P_{c}'$

-   Producers receive $P_{s}' = P_{c}' - t$

-   $P_{0} - P_{s}'$ is larger than $P_{c}' - P_{0}$

    -   Firms absorb more of the economic incidence

    -   They are less able to adjust production to avoid the tax

## Unit Tax on Sellers - Math

-   We can show the same result mathematically

-   Use linear inverse demand and supply curves with clean numbers

$$\text{Demand: } P_{c}=14-Q_{c},\quad \text{Supply: } P_{s}=2+Q_{s}$$

-   Equilibrium without tax is where $P_{s}=P_{c} = P_{0}$, $Q_{c}=Q_{s}= Q_{0}$

$$ 14-Q_{0}=2+Q_{0} $$ $$ 12 = 2Q_{0} \Rightarrow Q_{0}=6 $$ - Sub $Q_{0}$ into either equation to get $P_{0}$

$$ P_{0} = 14 - 6 = 8 $$

## Unit Tax on Sellers - Math

-   Now introduce a per unit tax $t=4$ on sellers

-   In equilibrium, $P_{s} + t = P_{c}$ and $Q_{c} = Q_{s} = Q_{1}$

    -   There is a wedge between what consumers pay and what producers receive

-   Substituting in the equations for demand and supply

$$ 14 - Q_{1}  = 2 + Q_{1} + 4$$ $$ 14 - Q_{1} = 6 + Q_{1} \Rightarrow Q_{1} = 4 $$

-   Sub $Q_{1}$ into either equation to get $P_{c}$ or $P_{s}$

$$ P_{c} = 14 - 4 = 10 $$ $$ P_{s} = 2 + 4 = 6 $$

## Unit Tax on Sellers - Math

-   Key things to take away when the tax is introduced

    -   Quantity falls from $Q_{0}=6$ to $Q_{1}=4$
    -   Consumers pay $P_{c}=10$, which is $10-8=2$ more than before tax
    -   Producers receive $P_{s}=6$, which is $8-6=2$ less than before tax
    -   Economic incidence is shared equally between consumers and producers

-   Example is specific to when demand and supply have the same slope

-   In general, economic incidence with linear demand and supply and a unit tax depends on elasticities of supply and demand

$$ \Delta P_{c} = P_{c} - P_{0} = \frac{\varepsilon_s}{\varepsilon_s + |\varepsilon_d|}t, \quad \Delta P_{s}= P_{0} - P_{s} = \frac{|\varepsilon_d|}{\varepsilon_s + |\varepsilon_d|}t$$

-   $\varepsilon_s = \frac{dQ_s}{dP_s}\frac{P}{Q}$ is elasticity of supply and $\varepsilon_d = \frac{dQ_d}{dP_c}\frac{P}{Q}$ is elasticity of demand

## Unit Tax on Buyers - Graphical

-   More rarely, taxes are levied on buyers of goods and services

-   We can use the same graphical tools to examine this case

-   Key lesson is that **economic incidence does not depend on whether the tax is levied on buyers or sellers**

-   Now government levies a per unit tax $t$ (e.g. \$0.10/litre) on gasoline

-   Assume gas tax is levied on **buyers** (statutory incidence)

-   This shifts the demand curve down by the amount of the tax

    -   New demand curve is $D'$
    -   At each quantity, buyers want to pay $t$ less to cover the tax

-   New equilibrium is where $S$ intersects $D'$

    -   Determines price received by the seller

-   Notice that $P_{s}$ and $P_{c}$ are the same as when the tax was levied on sellers

    -   Producers receive $P_{s}$
    -   Consumers pay $P_{c} = P_{s} + t$
    -   Quantity falls to $Q_{1}$

-   In this case, the slopes are equal so the burden is shared

-   Changes in elasticities affect economic burden in the same way
:::
::::::

## Unit Tax on Buyers - Math

-   The math is exactly the same as when the tax is levied on sellers

$$\text{Demand: } P_{c}=14-Q_{c},\quad \text{Supply: } P_{s}=2+Q_{s}$$

-   Tax is $t=4$ on buyers

-   In equilibrium, $P_{s} = P_{c} - t$ and $Q_{c} = Q_{s} = Q_{1}$

-   Algebra is same as we did above, so we get the same results

$$ P_{c} = 10 $$ $$ P_{s} = 6 $$

## Unit Taxes - Takeaways

-   Statutory incidence does not determine economic incidence

-   Economic incidence depends on elasticities of supply and demand

    -   More elastic demand means consumers bear less of the economic incidence
    -   More elastic supply means producers bear less of the economic incidence

-   Economic incidence does not depend on whether the tax is levied on buyers or sellers

## Ad Valorem Taxes

-   So far we have only considered unit taxes

    -   A fixed amount per unit sold (e.g. \$0.10/litre)

-   More common are **ad valorem taxes**

    -   A percentage of the price (e.g. 13% HST on most goods and services)

-   Ad valorem taxes create a tax wedge that increases with the price

    -   Higher priced goods have a larger tax wedge

-   As before

    -   Economic incidence depends on elasticities of supply and demand
    -   Economic incidence does not depend on whether the tax is levied on buyers or sellers

-   Analysis is similar to unit tax except supply curve shifts up and becomes steeper

-   If tax is levied on buyers, demand curve shifts down and becomes flatter

-   Still a wedge between what consumers pay and what producers receive

-   Economic burden on sellers decreases with supply elasticity

-   Economic burden on buyers decreases with demand elasticity

## Unit Tax on a Monopolist

-   So far we have only considered perfectly competitive markets
-   What happens when there is only one seller in the market?
-   A tax increases marginal cost, so the monopolist produces less
-   Effects of the tax are potentially different from competitive markets
    -   Quantity will fall

    -   Price paid by consumers will rise

    -   But, price received by the monopolist may rise or fall

        -   Depends on cost structure and demand elasticity

-   ATC curve omitted for graph clarity

-   Example: market for movie tickets

-   Equilibrium is where $MR = MC$

    -   Price is $P_{0}$
    -   Quantity is $Q_{0}$

-   Government levies a per unit tax $t$ on each ticket sold

-   This shifts the cost curves up by the amount of the tax

    -   New marginal cost is $MC'$

-   Equilibrium is where $MR = MC'$

    -   Price paid by consumers is $P_{c}$
    -   Price received by monopolist is $P_{s} = P_{c} - t$
    -   Quantity is lower at $Q_{1}$

-   Consumers bear more of the tax if

    -   Demand is inelastic
    -   Marginal cost is relatively flat

# Taxes on Factor Markets in Partial Equilibrium Models

## Introduction

-   So far we have only considered taxes on goods and services

-   Taxes can also be levied on factors of production

    -   Labour
    -   Capital

-   Taxes affect prices paid for and received by those factors

    -   Example: payroll taxes affect wages paid and received

-   Taxes also affect quantities of factors employed

-   Analysis is the same as taxes on goods and services

    -   Only difference is that firms are buyers and households are sellers

## Payroll Tax on Workers

-   Suppose government levies a payroll tax $t$ on workers

    -   Example: Employment Insurance (EI) premiums paid by employees
    
-  This shifts the supply curve of labour up by the amount of the tax

    -   At each quantity, workers want to be paid $t$ more to cover the tax
    
- Creates wedge between what workers are paid and what they keep

    -   Firms now pay $W_{f}$
    -   Workers receive $W_{w} = W_{f} - t$
:::
::::::

## Payroll Tax on Workers

- Incidence again depends on supply and demand elasticity

- A more inelastic supply curve means workers bear more of the economic incidence

    -   They are less able to change work hours when wages change
    - Makes them stuck in a job, so they bear more of the tax
    
- A more inelastic demand curve means firms bear more of the economic incidence

    -   They are less able to substitute between labour and other inputs
    -   Makes number of workers inflexible, so they bear more of the tax

- Does not matter if tax is levied on workers or firms

  - In reality payroll taxes are often levied on both
