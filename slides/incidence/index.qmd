# Goals of This Section

## Goals of This Section

-   Outline different types of taxes

-   Discuss different between statutory and economic incidence of a tax

-   Show how tax incidence depends on elasticities of supply and demand

-   Expand on tax incidence in various markets

# Types of Taxes

## Introduction

-   There are many different types of taxes

-   Taxes can have different goals

    -   Raise revenue for government spending
    -   Change behaviour of individuals or firms
    -   Redistribute resources

-   They can also have different bases, structures, and rates

    -   Base: what is being taxed (e.g. income, consumption, property)
    -   Structure: how the tax is applied (e.g. progressive, regressive, flat)
    -   Rate: how much is being taxed (e.g. percentage, fixed amount)

-   Below we cover some of the most common types of taxes

## Taxes on Income

-   **Income Tax**: tax on income earned during the year

-   Can be levied on individuals or corporations

-   For individuals, includes but not limited to

    -   Labour market earnings
    -   Capital gains
    -   Investment income (e.g. from dividends, interest, property)
    -   Pensions and retirement income (e.g. RRSPs)
    -   Some government benefits (e.g. employment insurance)
    -   Other taxable benefits (e.g. premiums paid by employer for group life insurance)

## Taxes on Income

-   For corporations, includes but not limited to

    -   Active business income from sales or goods and services
    -   Investment income
    -   Capital gains
    -   Some government grants
    -   Depends on the size of your business
        -   Small business pay a lower rate

## Payroll Taxes

-   **Payroll Taxes**: taxes levied on employment income

    -   Paid by both employers and employees

-   Used to finance social insurance and public pension programs

    -   Examples: Employment Insurance (EI), Canada Pension Plan (CPP), worker compensation

-   Payroll taxes vary by province

    -   Some charge a health tax (e.g. BC Employer Health Tax)
    -   Manitoba charges a levy for health and postsecondary education

-   These are different from the general income tax

## Consumption Taxes

-   **Consumption Tax**: a tax paid on consumption of goods and services

-   Taxes generally charged by a seller at point of sale

    -   They remit these funds to the government

-   Examples:

    -   Sales tax (e.g. GST, HST, PST)
    -   Excise taxes (e.g. gasoline, alcohol, tobacco)
    -   Tariffs (tax on imports)

## Wealth Taxes

-   **Wealth Taxes**: taxes on the value of an asset

-   Typical wealth taxes include

    -   Property tax (tax on value of land/buildings)
    -   Estate tax (tax on value of estate at death)
    -   General wealth tax (tax on total value of assets owned)

-   Estate taxes and general wealth taxes are not used in Canada

-   Property taxes are a major source of revenue for municipal governments

# Statutory vs Economic Incidence of a Tax

## Introduction

-   The question of who "pays" a tax is more complicated than it seems

-   Example: in Canada, there is a federal \$0.10/litre tax on gasoline

    -   Gasoline stations include this in their price
    -   They remit the tax to the government
    -   Does the seller or the consumer pay?

-   This section will clarify who pays a tax

-   Separate between **statutory** and **economic** incidence of a tax

-   My view: this is the most important concept we teach in this program

## Statutory vs Economic Incidence of a Tax

-   **Statutory Incidence**: who is legally responsible for paying the tax to the government

    -   In the gasoline tax example, the statutory incidence is on the gasoline station

        -   They send a cheque to the government

-   **Economic Incidence**: the change in real income brought about by the tax

    -   In the gasoline tax example, the economic incidence can be shared between the gasoline station and the consumer

        -   The gasoline station may less revenue per litre sold
        -   The consumer may pay a higher price per litre purchased

## Statutory vs Economic Incidence of a Tax

-   Example: \$0.10/litre tax on gasoline

    -   Before tax is imposed, suppose price is \$1.00/litre

        -   Consumers pay \$1.00/litre, gas station receives \$1.00/litre

    -   Then government levies \$0.10/litre tax on gasoline station

        -   Suppose gasoline station raises price to \$1.10/litre
        -   Consumer pays \$1.10/litre
        -   Gas station keeps \$1.00/litre, remits \$0.10/litre to government

    -   In this case, the consumer bears the entire economic incidence of the tax

        -   Gasoline station receives same revenue per litre as before tax
        -   Consumer pays \$0.10/litre more than before tax

## Statutory vs Economic Incidence of a Tax

-   Example 2: \$0.10/litre tax on gasoline

    -   Same \$0.10/litre tax on gas station

        -   Suppose gas station raises price to \$1.05/litre
        -   Consumer pays \$1.05/litre
        -   Gas station keeps \$0.95/litre, remits \$0.10/litre to government

    -   In this case, the consumer and gas station share the economic incidence of the tax

        -   Gas station receives \$0.05/litre less than before tax
        -   Consumer pays \$0.05/litre more than before tax

## Statutory vs Economic Incidence of a Tax

-   Key lesson is that **statutory incidence does not determine economic incidence**

    -   In example, statutory incidence is always on the gas station
    -   Economic incidence depends on how much of the tax is passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices
    -   Gas station could pass on all, some, or none of the tax to consumers

-   Statutory incidence says nothing about economic incidence

-   To determine economic incidence, we need to look at underlying economic forces

-   Take gasoline tax example one more time

-   On right is demand and supply of litres of gasoline

-   Without tax, price and quantity are determined where demand and supply are equal

    -   Price is $P_{0}$

    -   Quantity is $Q_{0}$

-   Now government levies a per unit tax $t$ (e.g. \$0.10/litre) on gasoline

-   Tax is levied on **sellers** (statutory incidence)

-   This shifts the supply curve up by the amount of the tax

    -   New supply curve is $S'$
    -   At each quantity, sellers want to charge $t$ more to cover the tax

-   New equilibrium is where $S'$ intersects $D$

    -   Determines price paid by consumers

-   The tax introduces a **tax wedge**

    -   Difference between what consumers pay and what producers receive from a transaction

-   Consumers pay the equilibrium price $P_{c}$

    -   Price includes the tax

-   Producers receive $P_{s} = P_{c} - t$

    -   They remit $t$ for every unit sold

-   Quantity falls to $Q_{1}$
:::
::::::

## Unit Tax on Sellers - Graphical

-   In example above, economic incidence is shared equally between consumers and producers

    -   Consumers pay $P_{c} - P_{0}$ more than before tax
    -   Producers receive $P_{0} - P_{s}$ less than before tax
    -   These amounts are equal

-   Equal economic incidence is specific to this example because supply and demand have the same slope

-   In general, **economic incidence depends on the elasticities of supply and demand**

    -   A more elastic demand curve means consumers bear less of the economic incidence

        -   Higher elasticity means consumers can switch to other goods when price changes

    -   A more elastic supply curve means producers bear less of the economic incidence

        -   A firm with higher elasticity can alter production easily when prices change

-   Graph to the right shows a more inelastic demand curve

-   After tax consumers pay $P_{c}$

-   Producers receive $P_{s} = P_{c} - t$

-   But $P_{c} - P_{0}$ is now larger than $P_{0} - P_{s}$

    -   Inelastic demand means consumers less able to substitute

    -   They absorb more of the economic incidence

-   In extreme with perfectly inelastic demand, consumers bear entire economic incidence

    -   Perfect inelastic demand means complete inability to substitute

-   After tax consumers pay $P_{c} = P_{0} + t$

-   Producers receive $P_{s} = P_{c} - t = P_{0}$

-   No change in quantity

    -   Since consumers demand $Q_{0} = Q_{1}$ at any price

-   Now imagine a more inelastic supply curve

    -   Firms less able to adjust quantities when prices change

-   After tax consumers pay $P_{c}'$

-   Producers receive $P_{s}' = P_{c}' - t$

-   $P_{0} - P_{s}'$ is larger than $P_{c}' - P_{0}$

    -   Firms absorb more of the economic incidence

    -   They are less able to adjust production to avoid the tax
:::
::::::

## Unit Tax on Sellers - Math

-   We can show the same result mathematically

-   Use linear inverse demand and supply curves with clean numbers

$$\text{Demand: } P_{c}=14-Q_{c},\quad \text{Supply: } P_{s}=2+Q_{s}$$

-   Equilibrium without tax is where $P_{s}=P_{c} = P_{0}$, $Q_{c}=Q_{s}= Q_{0}$

$$ 14-Q_{0}=2+Q_{0} $$ $$ 12 = 2Q_{0} \Rightarrow Q_{0}=6 $$

-   Sub $Q_{0}$ into either equation to get $P_{0}$

$$ P_{0} = 14 - 6 = 8 $$

## Unit Tax on Sellers - Math

-   Now introduce a per unit tax $t=4$ on sellers

-   In equilibrium, $P_{s} + t = P_{c}$ and $Q_{c} = Q_{s} = Q_{1}$

    -   There is a wedge between what consumers pay and what producers receive

-   Substituting in the equations for demand and supply

$$ 14 - Q_{1}  = 2 + Q_{1} + 4$$ $$ 14 - Q_{1} = 6 + Q_{1} \Rightarrow Q_{1} = 4 $$

-   Sub $Q_{1}$ into either equation to get $P_{c}$ or $P_{s}$

$$ P_{c} = 14 - 4 = 10 $$ $$ P_{s} = 2 + 4 = 6 $$

## Unit Tax on Sellers - Math

-   Key things to take away when the tax is introduced

    -   Quantity falls from $Q_{0}=6$ to $Q_{1}=4$
    -   Consumers pay $P_{c}=10$, which is $10-8=2$ more than before tax
    -   Producers receive $P_{s}=6$, which is $8-6=2$ less than before tax
    -   Economic incidence is shared equally between consumers and producers

-   Example is specific to when demand and supply have the same slope

-   In general, economic incidence with linear demand and supply and a unit tax depends on elasticities of supply and demand

$$ \Delta P_{c} = P_{c} - P_{0} = \frac{\varepsilon_s}{\varepsilon_s + |\varepsilon_d|}t, \quad \Delta P_{s}= P_{0} - P_{s} = \frac{|\varepsilon_d|}{\varepsilon_s + |\varepsilon_d|}t$$

-   $\varepsilon_s = \frac{dQ_s}{dP_s}\frac{P}{Q}$ is elasticity of supply and $\varepsilon_d = \frac{dQ_c}{dP_c}\frac{P}{Q}$ is elasticity of demand

## Unit Tax on Buyers - Graphical

-   More rarely, taxes are levied on buyers of goods and services

-   We can use the same graphical tools to examine this case

-   Key lesson is that **economic incidence does not depend on whether the tax is levied on buyers or sellers**

-   Now government levies a per unit tax $t$ (e.g. \$0.10/litre) on gasoline

-   Assume gas tax is levied on **buyers** (statutory incidence)

-   This shifts the demand curve down by the amount of the tax

    -   New demand curve is $D'$
    -   At each quantity, buyers want to pay $t$ less to cover the tax

-   New equilibrium is where $S$ intersects $D'$

    -   Determines price received by the seller

-   Notice that $P_{s}$ and $P_{c}$ are the same as when the tax was levied on sellers

    -   Producers receive $P_{s}$
    -   Consumers pay $P_{c} = P_{s} + t$
    -   Quantity falls to $Q_{1}$

-   In this case, the slopes are equal so the burden is shared

-   Changes in elasticities affect economic burden in the same way
:::
::::::

## Unit Tax on Buyers - Math

-   The math is exactly the same as when the tax is levied on sellers

$$\text{Demand: } P_{c}=14-Q_{c},\quad \text{Supply: } P_{s}=2+Q_{s}$$

-   Tax is $t=4$ on buyers

-   In equilibrium, $P_{s} = P_{c} - t$ and $Q_{c} = Q_{s} = Q_{1}$

-   Algebra is same as we did above, so we get the same results

$$ P_{c} = 10 $$ $$ P_{s} = 6 $$

## Unit Taxes - Takeaways

-   Statutory incidence does not determine economic incidence

-   Economic incidence depends on elasticities of supply and demand

    -   More elastic demand means consumers bear less of the economic incidence
    -   More elastic supply means producers bear less of the economic incidence

-   Economic incidence does not depend on whether the tax is levied on buyers or sellers

## Ad Valorem Taxes

-   So far we have only considered unit taxes

    -   A fixed amount per unit sold (e.g. \$0.10/litre)

-   More common are **ad valorem taxes**

    -   A percentage of the price (e.g. 13% HST on most goods and services)

-   Ad valorem taxes create a tax wedge that increases with the price

    -   Higher priced goods have a larger tax wedge

-   As before

    -   Economic incidence depends on elasticities of supply and demand
    -   Economic incidence does not depend on whether the tax is levied on buyers or sellers

-   Analysis is similar to unit tax except supply curve shifts up and becomes steeper

-   If tax is levied on buyers, demand curve shifts down and becomes flatter

-   Still a wedge between what consumers pay and what producers receive

-   Economic burden on sellers decreases with supply elasticity

-   Economic burden on buyers decreases with demand elasticity
:::
::::::

## Unit Tax on a Monopolist

-   So far we have only considered perfectly competitive markets
-   What happens when there is only one seller in the market?
-   A tax increases marginal cost, so the monopolist produces less
-   Effects of the tax are potentially different from competitive markets
    -   Quantity will fall

    -   Price paid by consumers will rise

    -   But, price received by the monopolist may rise or fall

        -   Depends on cost structure and demand elasticity

-   Equilibrium is where $MR = MC$

    -   Price is $P_{0}$
    -   Quantity is $Q_{0}$

-   Government levies a per unit tax $t$ on each ticket sold

-   This shifts the cost curves up by the amount of the tax

    -   New marginal cost is $MC'$

-   Equilibrium is where $MR = MC'$

    -   Price paid by consumers is $P_{c}$
    -   Price received by monopolist is $P_{s} = P_{c} - t$
    -   Quantity is lower at $Q_{1}$

-   Consumers bear more of the tax if

    -   Demand is inelastic
    -   Marginal cost is relatively flat

# Taxes on Factor Markets in Partial Equilibrium Models

## Introduction

-   So far we have only considered taxes on goods and services

-   Taxes can also be levied on factors of production

    -   Labour
    -   Capital

-   Taxes affect prices paid for and received by those factors

    -   Example: payroll taxes affect wages paid and received

-   Taxes also affect quantities of factors employed

-   Analysis is the same as taxes on goods and services

    -   Only difference is that firms are buyers and households are sellers

## Payroll Tax on Workers

-   Suppose government levies a payroll tax $t$ on workers

    -   Example: Employment Insurance (EI) premiums paid by employees

-   This shifts the supply curve of labour up by the amount of the tax

    -   At each quantity, workers want to be paid $t$ more to cover the tax

-   Creates wedge between what workers are paid and what they keep

    -   Firms now pay $W_{f}$
    -   Workers receive $W_{w} = W_{f} - t$
:::
::::::

## Payroll Tax on Workers

-   Incidence again depends on supply and demand elasticity

-   A more inelastic supply curve means workers bear more of the economic incidence

    -   They are less able to change work hours when wages change
    -   Makes them stuck in a job, so they bear more of the tax

-   A more inelastic demand curve means firms bear more of the economic incidence

    -   They are less able to substitute between labour and other inputs
    -   Makes number of workers inflexible, so they bear more of the tax

-   Does not matter if tax is levied on workers or firms

    -   In reality payroll taxes are often levied on both

## Capital Taxation

-   Labour is not the only input into production

-   Capital is also used

    -   For this analysis, think of capital as the money used to finance machines, factories, etc

-   Capital owners earn a return on investments, and that can be taxed

-   The analysis of taxing capital is the same as for labour

    -   Except that the rate of return ($r$) is the price

    -   Total investment (dollars) is the quantity

    -   Firms are the buyers, people with money are the suppliers

## Capital Taxation

-   A key consideration in the analysis is **capital mobility** across countries

    -   The ease with which people can move money and invest around the globe

-   If capital is perfectly mobile, the buyers of capital bear the entire burden

    -   Perfect mobility means a perfectly elastic supply curve

    -   The price is set at the global rate of return

    -   When supply is perfectly elastic, buyers bear the whole tax burden

-   In reality, capital is mobile but not perfectly

    -   Buyers and sellers are likely to bear some of the burden of capital taxation

## Taxes on Profits and Land

-   Governments can also levy taxes on economic profits

    -   **Economic profits**: profits above a normal rate of return

-   These types of taxes are borne entirely by firms

    -   Maximizing untaxed profits and taxed profits yields the same prices and quantities

-   To see this, consider a monopoly (because this would be a market where economic profits happen)

-   Without taxes, maximize

$$\Pi(q)=p(q)q-C(q)=(a-c)q-bq^2$$

-   Take the derivative with respect to $q$

$$(a-c)-2bq=0$$

## Taxes on Profits and Land

-   Solve for $q$ to get the profit maximizing quantity

$$ q^*=\frac{a-c}{2b}$$

-   Price is then

$$ p^*=a-bq^*=\frac{a+c}{2} $$

-   With taxes, maximize

$$(1-t)\Pi(q)=(1-t)(p(q)q-C(q))=(1-t)((a-c)q-bq^2)$$

## Taxes on Profits and Land

-   Take the derivative with respect to $q$

$$(1-t)((a-c)-2bq)=0$$

-   Which leads to the same prices and quantities

-   Means that the economic incidence of profit taxes is entirely on firms

    -   Profits go from $\Pi(q^*)$ to $(1-t)\Pi(q^*)$

-   Problem with these taxes is that they are hard to implement in practice

## Taxes on Land

-   Historically there were taxes on only land

    -   As opposed to modern property taxes that also tax buildings

-   When land is taxed the incidence is entirely on current owners

    -   The value of the land drops by the amount of the current and future tax obligations

-   Can see this by looking at the value for a piece of land

-   Without taxes, the value of land is the present value of future rents

$$ P_R = \sum_{t=0}^{T} \frac{R_t}{(1+r)^t} $$

## Taxes on Land

-   If there is a tax $t$ on land, the value becomes $$ P'_R = \sum_{t=0}^{T} \frac{R_t(1-u_{t})}{(1+r)^t} $$

-   The difference between $P_R$ and $P'_R$ is the present value of all future tax obligations

$$ P_R - P'_R = -\sum_{t=0}^{T} \frac{ u_{t}}{(1+r)^t} $$

-   When the tax is levied, the value of the land immediately drops by the tax obligation

    -   So it is borne by the current owner

# General Equilibrium

## Introduction

-   So far we have only considered partial equilibrium models

    -   One market at a time

-   It is informative, but incomplete

-   In reality, markets are interconnected

    -   A tax in one market can affect other markets

    -   Example: a tax on goods can affect labour market

        -   If people buy less, firms produce less
        -   Firms hire fewer workers
        -   Labour market is affected

-   General equilibrium models consider all markets simultaneously

-   Consider a unit tax on restaurants

-   For simplicity, assume restaurant means have perfectly elastic demand

    -   People are very sensitive to the price and will go elsewhere if price rises

-   The full burden of the tax is on the restaurants

-   Quantity of meals falls because of the tax
:::
::::::

## A Tax on Goods and Services

-   But a restaurant cannot beaer taxes

-   A restaurant is really a production process that combines labour and capital

    -   A production process cannot pay a tax

-   It is ultimately the workers and owners of capital that pay the tax

-   The tax on meals will filter down to the labour and capital markets

    -   Workers will get paid less
    -   Owners of capital will earn less

-   Consider the labour market for restaurant workers

-   The tax on meals shifts the demand for restaurant workers to the left

    -   Labour demand is derived partly from the demand for meals
    -   Less demand for meals means less demand for workers

-   The equilibrium wage falls and workers are paid less

-   Part of the burden falls on workers in the form of lower wages

-   Similar things happen in the capital market

-   The tax on meals shifts the demand for capital to the left

    -   Less demand for meals means less demand for capital

-   The equilibrium return to capital falls and owners are paid less

-   Part of the burden falls on owners of capital in the form of lower returns
:::
::::::

## A Tax on Goods and Services

-   The degree to which workers and owners of capital bear the burden depends on elasticities

    -   More elastic labour supply means workers bear less of the burden

    -   More elastic capital supply means owners of capital bear less of the burden

-   In our example, we assumed perfectly elastic demand for meals

    -   This meant that restaurants bore the entire burden of the tax

-   If consumer demand were less elastic

    -   Consumers would bear some of the burden

    -   Would affect other goods they consume

        -   Increase consumption of substitutes
        -   Decrease consumption of complements
        -   Decrease consumption of all goods via an income effect

## A Tax on Goods and Services

-   General equilibrium analysis can get very complicated

    -   Many interconnected markets

    -   Changes in one market affect many others

-   Can affect markets vertically and horizontally

    -   Vertically: factors of production

    -   Horizontally: related goods (e.g. tax on coffee affects tea market)

-   Main lesson is still the same: **statutory incidence does not determine economic incidence**

## Tax Equivalencies

-   In general equilibrium, different types of taxes can have the same economic incidence

    -   Example: a tax on labour income and a tax on consumption can have the same economic incidence

-   A policy maker would have options when it comes to which tax to levy

-   Consider an economy with

    -   Two commodities, food ($F$) and manufacturing ($M$)
    -   Two factors of production, labour ($L$) and capital ($K$)

## Tax Equivalencies

-   A government could levy nine different types of taxes

    -   Food: tax on capital ($t_{KF}$), tax on labour ($t_{LF}$), tax on consumption ($t_F$)
    -   Manufacturing: tax on capital ($t_{KM}$), tax on labour ($t_{LM}$), tax on consumption ($t_M$)
    -   Both: tax on capital ($t_K$), tax on labour ($t_L$)
    -   An income tax ($t$)

-   Taxes levied on factors of production in one sector are **Partial Factor Taxes**

    -   In this case $t_{KF}$, $t_{LF}$, $t_{KM}$, $t_{LM}$

-   Combinations of these taxes can be equivalent to other taxes

## Harberger Model

-   Arnold Harberger studied tax incidence in general equilibrium

-   Basics of his model

    -   Technology

        -   Capital and labour used in production
        -   Constant returns to scale
        -   Ease of substitution between capital and labour different between sectors

    -   Factor suppliers

        -   Capital and labour perfectly mobile
        -   Returns to both are the same in both sectors

    -   Market structure is perfecly competitive

    -   Factors are in fixed supply

    -   Consumers are all the same

## Harberger Model

-   Suppose a tax on food ($t_F$) is introduced

    -   Price of food rises
    -   Consumers buy less food, more manufacturing
    -   Demand for labour and capital in food sector falls
    -   As labour and capital move to manufacturing, their returns fall

-   Strength of these effects depend on elasticities

    -   If food elasticity is high, consumers shift more to manufacturing
        -   Returns to labour and capital fall more for manufacturing to induce movement

## Harberger Model

-   Suppose an income tax ($t$) is introduced

    -   Use equivalencies table
    -   Income tax is equivalent to a combination of taxes on capital and labour
    -   Both are in fixed supply (perfectly inelastic) so they bear the whole burden

-   A tax on labour ($t_L$) is introduced

    -   Tax on labour in both sectors
    -   Labour supply is perfectly inelastic so it bears the whole burden
    -   No incentive to switch between sectors

## Harberger Model

-   Finally, a partial factor tax on capital in manufacturing ($t_{KM}$)

    -   Price of manufacturing rises
        -   Use less capital and labour
        -   As capital and labour leave, changes in their relative prices depend on how much is used
    -   Producers of manufactured goods use less capital and more labour
        -   Demand for capital falls, and so does relative price
    -   Cannot tell what the ultimate effect is on capital prices
        -   But labour price rises

## Summary

-   Tax incidence is not necessarily contained to the market where the tax is levied

-   In general equilibrium, taxes can have far reaching effects

    -   Both vertically and horizontally

-   A full analysis requires consideration of all markets simultaneously

-   The key points to remember are

    -   Statutory incidence does not determine economic incidence
    -   Economic incidence depends on ability to substitute and avoid the tax

# Quantifying Tax Incidence

## Introduction

-   We have gone through the theory of tax incidence

-   Using data we can see who bears the burden of various taxes

-   Could do this with tax data

    -   Statistics Canada maintains the Longitudinal Administrative Databank (LAD)
    -   Not easy to use because it is confidential microdata

-   Can also use data from the SPSDM simulator

    -   Program maintained by Statistics Canada
    -   Snapshot of the Canadian tax and transfer system at a point in time

## Partial Equilibrium

-   Canada maintains a progressive personal income tax system

    -   So tax rates rise with income

-   Commodity and property taxes are *on their own* regressive

    -   A regressive tax is one where tax rates fall with income
    -  Tax credits help offset the regressivity of these taxes (e.g. HST credit)

- Payroll taxes are initially progressive but turn regressive

- Federal taxes are more progressive than provincial taxes

    - Federal taxes mainly come from personal income taxes
    - Provincial taxes contain more commodity and property taxes
    
    
## Partial Equilibrium

-   Progressivity in these graphs is based on *annual* income

    -   Lifetime income might be more appropriate if people consume based on lifetime resources
    
- Redoing the graphs with lifetime income reduces regressivity


## General Equilibrium

- Evidence on the general equilibrium incidence of taxes is more limited

  - Analysis is more difficult
  
- Canadian researchers have looked at the tax incidence of the carbon tax in BC

  - Use a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model
  - A fancy model with many equations you need a computer to solve
  
- Find that a carbon tax

    - Lowers wages relative to capital income because labour is supply is inelastic
    - Labour bears more of the burden than capital
    - Tax is progressive because wages are a higher share of income for higher income households
 
 
# Summary

## Summary

-   Taxes are levied across the economy for various reasons

- Who "pays" the tax is determined by economic incidence and is complicated

  - Depends on ability to avoid the tax in both partial and general equilibrium
  - Can be spread widely in a general equilibrium setting
  
-   Statutory incidence does not determine economic incidence
