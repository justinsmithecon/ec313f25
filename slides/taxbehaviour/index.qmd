# Taxation and Labour Supply

## Introduction

-   In this section we introduce a model we use throughout the course

-   The model helps us understand how individuals make decisions about work

-   Individual choose between two goods

    -   Income
    -   Leisure

-   Choices are constrained by time and wage rate

-   There are a few wrinkles that make this market unique

## Preferences

-   Individuals have preferences over Income (I) and leisure (L)

    -   People like having income to consume goods/services

    -   Also like having non-work time

        -   Includes fun activities but also non-work tasks like chores, education, etc.

-   The tradeoffs people are willing to make between I and L are represented by indifference curves

    -   At every point along the curve the individual is equally happy
    -   Curves further from the origin represent higher levels of utility

## Preferences

::: {layout="[[-1], [1], [-1]]"}
![](images/clipboard-1603650311.png)
:::
::::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   On the left is a single indifference curve

-   Any point represents equal utility ($U_{0}$)

-   **Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS)**: the rate at which a person is willing to trade income for leisure while remaining equally happy

-   The MRS is the slope of the indifference curve at a point

-   Individuals have diminishing MRS

    -   Willing to give up less income for additional leisure the more leisure they already have

    -   Slope gets shallower with more leisure
:::
::::::

## Preferences

-   Indifference curves do not have to be smooth curves like the one shown

-   Could be straight lines

    -   Means the tradeoff between income and leisure is constant

    -   Willingness to trade away leisure for income does not depend on leisure

-   Could be "L" shaped

    -   Income and leisure must be consumed in fixed proportions

-   Mostly we will deal with smooth preferences

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Utility increases with curves further from the origin

    -   $U_{2} > U_{1} > U_{0}$
:::
::::::

## Constraints

-   Individuals do not choose income and leisure bundles on preference alone

-   They are constrained by

    -   The wage rate

    -   Total number of hours available

-   Budget constraint is also called

    -   Potential income constraint

    -   Full income constraint

## Constraints

:::::: columns

![](images/clipboard-3959746409.png)
:::
::::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Graph shows a linear budget constraint

-   There are $T$ total hours to allocate to work or leisure

-   Each hour worked gets wage of $w$

-   Person working $T$ hours (no leisure) earns $wT$ income

    -   Called "full income"
:::
::::::

## Constraints

-   Mathematically, the budget constraint is

$$I = w(T - L) $$ - Income is equal to income from working $(w(T - L))$

-   The slope of the budget constraint is $-w$

    -   The opportunity cost of leisure is the wage rate

    -   Each hour of leisure means one less hour worked, which means $w$ less income

-   Someone who works zero hours has $T$ leisure hours and no income

-   Someone who works $T$ hours has zero leisure hours and $wT$ income

## Constraints

![](images/clipboard-66085390.png)
:::
::::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Slope is the negative of the wage rate $w$

-   A lower wage means shallower slope

    -   If $w_{1} < w_{0}$, the budget line swivels down

    -   They intersect at leisure = $T$ because there are no work hours

-   Lower wage also means full income is lower

    -   Working all hours leads to less total labour earnings
:::
::::::

## Consumer Optimum

-   Work hours are chosen using the combination of preferences and constraints
-   The consumer optimum is the point that maximizes utility subject to the budget constraint
-   The optimum occurs where the budget constraint is tangent to an indifference curve
-   There are two possibilities for the optimum
    -   Non-participation: optimum occurs at the end of the budget constraint (full leisure)
    -   Participation: optimum occurs at an interior point (some leisure, some work)

## Consumer Optimum

-   Graph shows an optimum with participation

-   Optimum is where indifference curve is tangent to budget constraint

-   At the optimum, MRS = wage rate

    -   Willingness to trade leisure for income (MRS) equals ability to trade them (wage)

-   Optimal work hours are $h_{0} = T - L_{0}$

-   Optimal consumption is $I_{0} = W_{0}h_{0}$

## Personal Income Tax

-   The personal income tax affects the budget constraint

-   Suppose a proportional income tax at rate $t$ is introduced

-   The after-tax wage is now $w(1 - t)$

-   Tax causes the budget constraint to pivot inward

    -   Slope is now $-w(1 - t)$

    -   Full income is now $w(1 - t)T$
:::
::::::

## Personal Income Tax

-   When the budget constraint changes, so does the optimum

-   Suppose there is a proportional income tax at rate $t$

-   There are two effects of the tax on labour supply

    -   **Substitution effect**: leisure is relatively cheaper, so people want more leisure (work less)

    -   **Income effect**: people are poorer, so they want less leisure (work more)

-   The effect on labour supply is therefore ambiguous

    -   If substitution effect \> income effect, labour supply decreases

    -   If income effect \> substitution effect, labour supply increases

:::
::::::

## Personal Income Tax

-   In reality taxes are not flat

    -   Canada has a progressive income tax system

    -   Higher income is taxed at higher rates

-   This implies that the budget constraint becomes kinked

    -   As income goes up, the tax rate increases
    -   When the tax rate changes, the slope changes

-   The basic principles are the same

    -   Substitution and income effects still apply
    -   Labour supply effect is still ambiguous

-   Graph shows a proportional income tax with three brackets

-   Tax rates are $t_{3} > t_{2} > t_{1}$

-   Slope changes at each kink

    -   First kink happens with work hours $h_{0}$
    -   Second kink happens with work hours $h_{1}$

-   Graph shows increased leisure, but effect is ambiguous
:::
::::::

## Evidence on Labour Supply

-   The theory discusses effect of tax \*holding all else equal\*\*

-   In statistical work, this is not easy to do

    -   Many factors affect labour supply

    -   Isolating the effect of taxes is difficult

-   Studies show that

    -   Elasticity of hours worked for working age men is between -0.2 and 0.2
    -   For women is is between -0.2 and 0.5

-   Means that a reduction in wage based on income tax has a small effect on work hours

-   Effect on labour force participation is larger

# Caveats on Taxation and Labour Supply

## Individual vs Group Effects

-   We simplified the discussion by analyzing one specific type of person

-   But tax changes affect many types of people differently

-   A change from a flat to progressive tax might

    -   Increase the tax rate for some people
    -   Decrease the tax rate for others

-   They way they react will be different and for policy analysis we need to consider the group effects

## Human Capital

-   Taxes can affect decisions about education and training

-   We saw that taxes affect an individual's optimal labour supply at each wage

-   If a tax increases the optimum hours at each wage, it would increase the desire to get education/training

    -   This would make the worker more productive, and increase their wage
    -   Could lead to further increases in supply

-   The reverse would happen if tax decreases optimum hours at each wage

## Total Compensation

-   Wages are not the only part of compensation

    -   There are non-wage benefits like health insurance, retirement contributions, etc.

-   If taxes rise, firms may switch to non-taxed forms of compensation

-   The effect of the tax may be muted if firms can do this easily

## Expenditures

-   Governments use tax revenues to fund public services

-   That spending may itself affect labour supply

    -   Spending on child care would increase supply
    -   If spent on recreational facilities, parks, etc., may decrease supply

-   Need to think about this from a general equilibrium lens

# Labour Supply and Tax Revenues

## Introduction

-   As just noted, governments tax labour income to raise revenue

-   The tax revenue collected from this exercise is the tax rate times the tax base

    -   Tax base is the amount of income earned
    -   Which in our model is $w \times h$

-   So the tax revenue is $R = t \times w \times h$

-   As we saw, if the substitution effect is larger than the income effect, higher tax rates reduce labour supply

-   Means that as $t$ increases, $wh$ decreases

## Laffer Curve

-   The fact that higher tax rates may reduce labour supply has implications for tax revenue

-   The relationship between tax rates and tax revenue is called the **Laffer Curve**

-   The Laffer Curve shows that tax revenue is zero at both 0% and 100% tax rates

-   Initially as tax rates rise, revenue rises

-   But at some point, further increases in tax rates reduce revenue

    -   Because the reduction in labour supply is large enough that the tax base shrinks significantly

## Laffer Curve

![](images/ros55466_1806.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Laffer Curve

-   The Laffer Curve suggests there is an optimal tax rate when it comes to revenues

    -   At the peak of the curve where additional increases in tax rates do not increase revenue

-   Also suggests that when tax rates are too high, reducing them could increase revenue

-   However, determining the optimal tax rate is difficult in practice

    -   Depends on how responsive labour supply is to tax changes

    -   Empirical estimates suggest we are not near the peak of the Laffer Curve for labour income taxes in Canada

# Saving

## Introduction

-   In addition to labour supply, taxes affect saving

-   Saving is important because it funds investment

    -   Investment leads to capital accumulation

    -   Capital accumulation leads to economic growth

-   Taxes affect saving through reductions in the return

    -   Interest earned through saving counts as income
    -   That income is taxable

-   In this section we will look at how taxes affect saving behaviour in a life-cycle model

## Life-Cycle Model

-   The life-cycle model assumes individuals plan their consumption and saving over their lifetime

-   To keep things simple, we consider two time periods

    -   Present and future

-   Individuals have preferences for consumption in both periods

    -   Represented by indifference curves

-   They also have a budget constraint based on their income in both periods

    -   Says that the present value of consumption equals the present value of income

## Life-Cycle Model

-   Algebraically, the budget constraint is

$$ c_{0} + \frac{c_{1}}{1 + r} = I_{0} + \frac{I_{1}}{1 + r} $$

-   Where

    -   $c_{0}$ = consumption in present period
    -   $c_{1}$ = consumption in future period
    -   $I_{0}$ = income in present period
    -   $I_{1}$ = income in future period
    -   $r$ = real interest rate

## Life-Cycle Model

-   You can plot this on a graph with $c_{0}$ on the x-axis and $c_{1}$ on the y-axis

-   Rearrange to get $c_{1}$ on left side

$$ c_{1} = (1 + r)(I_{0} - c_{0}) + I_{1} $$

-   Slope of budget constraint is $-(1 + r)$

    -   Consuming a dollar today means giving up $(1 + r)$ dollars tomorrow

-   When a person consumes $I_{0}$ today, they consume $I_{1}$ tomorrow

    -   The budget line passes through $(I_{0}, I_{1})$

## Life-Cycle Model

![](images/clipboard-2041314998.png)
:::
::::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Graph shows intertemporal budget constraint

-   Slope is $-(1 + r)$

-   Optimal consumption occurs where budget constraint is tangent to indifference curve

-   In this case, the person saves in period 0 to consume more in period 1

    -   Saving is the difference between income and consumption in period 0
:::
::::::

## Tax on Interest Income with Deductible Interest

-   Now suppose there is a tax on interest income at rate $t$

-   A person what saves \$1 in period 0 receives interest $r - rt$ in period 1

    -   Because the interest earned is taxed they must pay $rt$ on the interest
    -   This lowers the return

-   Means that foregoing \$1 in period 0 leads to consuming \$1 + r - rt = 1+(1-t)r \$ in period 1

    -   The after-tax interest rate is $r(1 - t)$

## Tax on Interest Income with Deductible Interest

-   A person what borrows \$1 in period 0 will need to pay interest $r - rt$ in period 1

    -   They pay interest $r$
    -   But because it is *tax deductible* they save $rt$ on taxes
    -   Means that total interest paid is $r - rt$

-   Means that borrowing \$1 in period 0 leads to foregoing \$1 + r - rt = 1+(1-t)r \$ of consumption in period 1

    -   The after-tax interest rate is $r(1 - t)$

-   So whether saving or borrowing, the after-tax interest rate is the same

-   Graph shows effect of tax on interest income on optimum

-   Tax rotates budget constraint around $(I_{0}, I_{1})$

    -   Slope falls from $-(1 + r)$ to $-(1 + r(1 - t))$
    -   Passes through $(I_{0}, I_{1})$ because no tax paid if no saving/borrowing

-   Two effects of taxation

    -   Substitution effect: opportunity cost of consumption today is lower, so consume more today (save less)
    -   Income effect: lower real income, so consume less in both periods (save more)

-   Total effect is ambiguous\

:::
::::::

## Tax on Interest Income with Nondeductible Interest

-   The deductibility of interest payments is important

    -   It made the cost of borrowing the same as the return to saving

-   Without deductibility, the after-tax interest rate for savers and borrowers differs

    -   A saver who saves \$1 in period 0 receives interest $r - rt$ in period 1

    -   A borrower who borrows \$1 in period 0 must pay interest $r$ in period 1

-   This creates a kink in the budget constraint at the point where consumption in both periods equals income

-   Graph shows the budget constraint without deductible interest

-   When the person saves ($c_{0} < I_{0}$), the slope is $-(1 + r(1 - t))$

- When they borrow ($c_{0} > I_{0}$), it is $-(1 + r)$

- The budget constraint is kinked at $(I_{0}, I_{1})$

    - Pivots downward to the left of that point
    - Stays the same to the right
    
:::
::::::

## Tax on Interest Income with Nondeductible Interest

- For savers prior to the tax, the effects are the same as with deductible interest

    - Substitution effect: consume more today (save less)
    - Income effect: consume less in both periods (save more)
    
- For borrowers prior to the tax, there is no effect

    - The after-tax interest rate is unchanged at $r$
    - No substitution or income effect
    

## Additional Considerations

- Models are intentionally simplifications of reality to help us understand key mechanisms

- The analysis is based on real interest rates, but most saving is done with nominal rates

    - Inflation and indexation can affect the real return after tax
    
- There is more than one interest rate in the economy

    - Different types of saving have different tax treatments and returns

- Life cycle model may not be a very good representation of how people behave

  - Some people are not able to borrow the optimal level
  - Others are not good at saving
  
  
## Evidence on Saving

- Researchers have analyzed the effect of taxation on saving

- Results show that the response to taxation is small

  - Interest elasticity of saving (responsiveness of saving to interest rate changes) is around 0.5
  - Varies by by demographics, including age

- Generally a hard econometric analysis

  - Many factors affect saving behaviour
  - Isolating the effect of taxes is difficult
  
  
## Savings Vehicles in Canada

- Canada has several ways to save 

  - Registered Pension Plans (RPPs)

      - Tax deductible contributions, taxed withdrawals

  - Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs)
  
      - Tax deductible contributions, taxed withdrawals
  
  - Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs)
  
      - Non-deductible contributions, tax-free withdrawals
  
- Other specialty ones like RESP, FHSA, etc.
  
  
  
## Savings Vehicles in Canada

- One way to encourage saving is to increase limits on these vehicles

- Not clear that this would encourage new saving

  - People may just shift existing saving into these vehicles
  - Existence of other savings methods means people can substitute
  
- Empirical work gives mixed results

  - Tax deferred savings plans increased savings in the 1970s
  - More recently, increasing RRSP limit had little effect on total saving
  
## Capital Taxation

- Taxing capital lowers the real return to investment

- As such, it may reduce the incentive to invest, and therefore capital accumulation and productivity

- Some argue that we should not tax capital income for this reason

- Debate is ongoing, but some things to keep in mind

  - Empirical studies show saving not that responsive to returns
  - In an open economy, domestic saving is used to fund domestic investment, but it may instead flow abroad
  - For economic efficiency, should tax factors that create the least excess burden
  
  
  
# Housing

## Housing and Saving

- When we think of capital, it is usually machines

  - Used to produce goods in manufacturing
  
- Housing is also part of capital 

  - Used to produce housing services
  - Generates income for some households
  
- In Canada, housing is subject to preferential tax treatment

  - No tax on imputed rent for owner-occupied housing
  - No capital gains tax on primary residences
  
- Leads to distortions in saving behaviour by encouraging investment in housing over other assets


## Housing and Saving


- To see the effect, consider a household choosing between housing and other assets

- If they invest $K$ dollars in another asset (say, a stock) 

  - They earn $R'$ dollars in money income
  - Also earn $C'$ in capital gains
  - These are taxed, so overall return is $\frac{(1-t)(R' + C')}{K}$

- Now consider investing $K$ in housing

  - They earn $R$ dollars in imputed rent (an in-kind return)
  - Also earn $C$ in capital gains
  - These are not taxed, so overall return is $\frac{R + C}{K}$
  
- Tax treament favours housing

## Housing and Saving

- What would the pre-tax return on the stock have to be to equalize after-tax returns?

  - Set after-tax returns equal:
  
$$ \frac{(1-t)(R' + C')}{K} = \frac{R + C}{K} $$

  - Rearranging gives:
  
$$ \frac{\frac{(R' + C')}{K}} {\frac{R + C}{K}} = \frac{1}{(1-t)}$$
  
- Pre-tax stock return has to be $\frac{1}{(1-t)}$ times the housing return to be equally attractive  

  - If $t = 0.25$, stock return has to be $\frac{1}{0.75} = 1.33$ times housing return
  
  
  
## Housing and Saving

- Estimated foregone government revenue from non-taxation of capital gains on housing is around \$10 billion per year
- No estimates from non-taxation of imputed rent, but it would be higher


- Preferential tax treatment distorts saving behaviour

  - Encourages investment in housing over other assets
  - Funds may not flow to their most productive uses
  
- There are also some policies that affect rental prices of housing, which distort behaviour


## Changes in Tax Treatment of Housing

- Should we tax imputed rent?

  - Would increase government revenue
  - But would be difficult to administer
  - Could reduce homeownership rates
  - Politically not feasible
  
- Principal residence exemption to capital gains is an ongoing debate

  - Since 2016 Canadians must declare a principal residence and its purchase price
  - Also report the disposition (sale)
  
  
  
# Portfolio Composition

## Introduction

- People invest in different types of assets

  - Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, real estate, etc.
  
- These assets have different returns and risk profiles

- May also have different tax treatment

- By changing the real return, taxes will alter the portfolio composition


## Portfolio Composition

- Imagine a simplified world with two assets

  - Cash: safe, but no return
  - Bond: positive return on average, but some risk of loss
  
- Prior to taxes, an investor decides on how much to hold of each

- Suppose then the government levies a tax on bond returns

    - Collects taxes if there is a positive return
    - Allows losses to be deducted from other income
    
- Two effects

  - Average return: because the tax reduces what the investor keeps, it reduces the return
  - Risk: because losses can be deducted, it reduces the risk of holding the bond
  
## Portfolio Composition

- Lower return makes the bond less attractive

- Lower risk makes the bond more attractive

- Overall the effect is ambiguous

    - Without loss deduction, likely it would be less attractive to hold bonds
    
- Thus taxes affect portfolio composition, but effect can be complicated


# Summary

## Summary

-   Income taxation affects labour supply through substitution and income effects

-   The Laffer Curve shows the relationship between tax rates and tax revenues

-   Taxes on interest income affect saving behaviour through substitution and income effects

-   Preferential tax treatment of housing distorts saving behaviour towards housing

-   Taxes affect portfolio composition by changing the return and risk of different assets
