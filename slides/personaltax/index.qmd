# Goals of This Section

## Goals of This Section

-   Outline history of personal income taxes in Canada

-   Describe how taxes are calculated

-   Discuss different concepts of income

-   Discuss tax rates

-   Explore other issues in income taxation

# History

## Origins

-   Income tax first introduced federally in Canada in 1917 to help finance WWI

    -   Initially a temporary measure, but became permanent in 1949

-   Provinces began introducing income taxes earlier, in the late 1800s (BC, PEI)

    -   Most others followed after the Great Depression
    -   Newfoundland was last to introduce income tax in 1949

-   Currently, both federal and provincial governments levy personal income taxes

    -   Authority comes from Constitution Act

## Other Details

-   Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) administers federal and most provincial income taxes

    -   Quebec administers its own provincial income tax

-   Because of this integration, people fill out one tax return for both federal and provincial taxes

    -   Except in Quebec, where two returns are filed

-   Up to 2000 provincial taxes operated on a "tax on tax" system

    -   Provincial taxes were a fraction of federal taxes owed

-   Since then provinces have moved to a "tax on income" system

    -   Provincial taxes are calculated on income before federal taxes are deducted

## Other Details

-   System based on self-assessment

    -   Taxpayers are responsible for reporting their income and calculating their taxes owed

-   Taxpayers have until April 30 of the following year to file their tax returns

    -   Penalties apply if taxes are owed

-   If you don't earn income, you don't have to file a tax return

    -   But strong incentive to file to claim benefits or credits
    -   About 12% of working age Canadians do not file a tax return

# Computing Personal Income Tax

## Tax Forms

-   The computation of your tax liability can be complicated

    -   Income comes from many sources
    -   Many deductions and credits are available

-   The CRA provides tax forms to help you compute your taxes

    -   Forms are available online or in paper format
    -   Many people use tax software to help with the process

-   The main federal tax form is the T1

    -   There are many additional forms (schedules) for specific types of income or deductions
    -   These forms are federal and provincial

-   Packages available here: <https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years.html>

## Calculating Taxes

-   The tax forms guide you through a series of steps to calculate your taxes

-   The process is algorithmic, and can be summarized in six main steps outlined in the next slides

-   Some key things to note

    -   Not all income sources are taxable
        -   Gifts, inheritances, lottery winnings, strike pay, legal settlements, first nations income on reserve, capital gains on principal residence, refundable tax credits are not taxable
    -   Not all income from taxable sources is subject to tax
        -   Certain income is deducted
        -   Deductions happen for different reasons
    -   Taxes are remitted to the government through withholding at source
        -   So at end of the year you pay the difference or get a refund

# Concepts of Income

## Haig-Simons Income

-   No definition of income in the Income Tax Act

-   **Haig-Simons definition** is often used in public finance

    -   Net increase in ability to consume during a period
    -   Income = Consumption + Additions to Net Wealth

-   Includes actual and potential increase in consumption ability

    -   E.g., unrealized capital gains are included

-   Also means decreases in consumption ability are negative income

    -   E.g., losses on investments are deductible

## Included Items

-   Employer pension contributions

    -   Adds to pension fund
    -   Increases ability to consume (in the future)

-   Transfer payments

    -   Retirement benefits, unemployment insurance, social assistance, workers' compensation
    -   All increase ability to consume

-   Capital gains/losses

    -   Increase in wealth from assets
    -   Realized (value gained after sale) and unrealized (value held prior to sale) gains
    -   Increases ability to consume
    -   Losses deducted because they decrease ability to consume

## Included Items

-   In-kind income

    -   Income received as goods/services rather than cash
    -   Employer perks (e.g., company car, subsidized housing)
    -   Free tuition for dependents of university employees
    -   Imputed rent from owner-occupied housing

-   Gifts and inheritances

    -   Increase wealth and ability to consume
    -   Not currently included in income for tax purposes in Canada (but is elsewhere, e.g., US)

## Problems with Haig-Simons

-   This concept of income is sometimes hard to implement in practice.

-   Business expenses

    -   Supposed to be expenses incurred to earn income
    -   Some expenses are part consumption part part business
        -   E.g., meals, travel, home office expenses

-   Capital gains/losses

    -   Sometimes hard to measure
    -   Easy for financial assets traded on markets
    -   Hard for other assets
        -   Cars, wine, jewelry, art, collectibles
        -   Cryptocurrencies and NFTs

## Problems with Haig-Simons

-   Imputed rent

    -   Hard to measure
    -   Varies by location, type of housing, size, amenities
    -   Also applies to non-housing assets that might be rented

-   In-kind income

    -   Markets exist for some of these, but not for others
    -   Household labour, volunteer work, parenting, merchandise discounts, etc. are hard to value

## Why Public Economists Use Haig-Simons

-   Haig-Simons income is a comprehensive measure of ability to pay

    -   Includes all sources of consumption and accumulation
    -   Forms a good base on which to tax individuals
    -   It is "fair" in that it captures all sources of income

-   Horizontal and vertical equity

    -   We noted that people with the same ability to pay should pay the same amount of tax
    -   People with greater ability to pay should pay more tax
    -   Basing it on this definition uses all income as basis for ability to pay

-   Efficiency

    -   Treats all forms of income the same
    -   No incentives to alter behaviour to avoid tax

## Income in Canada's Tax System

-   Much of the income counted in personal income taxes aligns with Haig-Simons

-   But there are some departures

    -   Some income sources are excluded (e.g., gifts, inheritances, lottery winnings, employer contributions to benefits)
    -   Some income sources are only partially included (e.g., capital gains)
    -   Some deductions are allowed that do not fit the concept (e.g., RRSP contributions)

-   Capital gains are a notable departure

    -   Only 50% of capital gains are included in income
    -   Gains on principal residences are not counted at all
    -   In the past there were large gains exemptions (i.e. gains below exemption not taxed)
    -   Only realized gains are taxed

## Income in Canada's Tax System

-   These departures can lead to differences in asset value over time

-   To see this with realized vs unrealized gains, consider this example

    -   A person buys an asset for \$100
    -   It appreciates in value by 20% per year over the next 5 years
    -   Asset is sold at the end of year 5
    -   Assume a 50% tax rate and an inclusion rate of 50%
    -   We will go over the tax implications of taxing realized versus unrealized gains

## Income in Canada's Tax System

-   Table below illustrates taxation on **realized gains**

| Year | Start Year Value |  Gain | Taxable Gain |  Tax | End Year Value |
|------|-----------------:|------:|-------------:|-----:|---------------:|
| 1    |           100.00 | 20.00 |         0.00 | 0.00 |         120.00 |
| 2    |           120.00 | 24.00 |         0.00 | 0.00 |         144.00 |
| 3    |           144.00 | 28.80 |         0.00 | 0.00 |         172.80 |
| 4    |           172.80 | 34.56 |         0.00 | 0.00 |         207.36 |
| 5    |           207.36 | 41.47 |         0.00 | 0.00 |         248.83 |

-   At the end of the 5 years, the gain is \$248.83 - \$100 = \$148.83
-   Tax paid is \$148.83 \* 50% \* 50% = \$37.21
-   After- tax value is \$248.83 - \$37.21 = \$211.62
-   After tax gain is \$111.62

## Income in Canada's Tax System

-   Table below illustrates taxation on **unrealized gains**

| Year | Start Year Value |  Gain | Taxable Gain |  Tax | End Year Value |
|------|-----------------:|------:|-------------:|-----:|---------------:|
| 1    |           100.00 | 20.00 |        10.00 | 5.00 |         115.00 |
| 2    |           115.00 | 23.00 |        11.50 | 5.75 |         132.25 |
| 3    |           132.25 | 26.45 |        13.23 | 6.61 |         152.09 |
| 4    |           152.09 | 30.42 |        15.21 | 7.60 |         174.90 |
| 5    |           174.90 | 34.98 |        17.49 | 8.75 |         201.14 |

-   Now the value at the end of year 5 is \$201.14
-   After-tax gain is \$201.14 - \$100 = \$101.14
-   Total gains are \$20 + \$23 + \$26.45 + \$30.42 + \$34.98 = \$134.85
-   Tax paid is \$5.00 + \$5.75 + \$6.61 + \$7.60 + \$8.75 = \$134.85 \* 50% \* 50% = \$33.71
    -   Less because the gains are smaller

## Income in Canada's Tax System

-   Taxation of realized gains locks in investments

    -   People may be reluctant to sell assets to avoid paying tax

-   This can lead to inefficiencies in the economy

    -   People hold onto assets that are not the best use of their resources
    -   Capital is not allocated to its most productive use

-   Conservatives proposed an deferral of taxation for investing in Canadian companies

    -   No gains tax if reinvested in Canadian companies
    -   Aimed at reducing lock-in effect and encouraging investment in Canada

## Income in Canada's Tax System

-   What if a person holds unrealized gains at death?

    -   CRA deems gains realized on date of death
    -   Taxes are owed by the estate
    -   If assets are bequeathed to someone else, the change in asset value since date of death is subject to gains tax

-   Why preferential treatment of capital gains?

    -   Encourages investment and risk-taking
    -   Compensates for deferring consumption
    -   Offsets increased tax burden from inflation (nominal gains)

## Income in Canada's Tax System

-   Contributions to pension plans (employee and employer) are not included in income until paid out

    -   Allows people to defer taxes until retirement

        -   Beneficial if people are in lower tax brackets when retired

    -   Interest also not taxed until withdrawn\

    -   Encourages saving for retirement

    -   But a departure from Haig-Simons definition of income

-   Finally gifts and inheritances are not taxed

    -   By Haig-Simons, they should be included in income because they increase ability to consume

# Tax Deductions and Credits

## Introduction

-   We discussed how income is calculated for tax purposes

-   There is a difference between

    -   Total income and taxable income

        -   **Deductions** exclude some income from being taxed

    -   Taxes owing and taxes payable

        -   **Credits** reduce taxes owing

-   There are various reasons for deductions and credits

    -   Social policy goals
    -   Economic efficiency
    -   Equity considerations

## Deductions

-   **Tax Deduction**: An amount that can be subtracted from total income to arrive at taxable income

-   In Canada, the main goals of deductions are to

    -   Recognize certain unavoidable expenses to earn income (e.g., child care, moving expenses)
    -   Encourage certain behaviours (e.g., saving for retirement, a home)
    -   Other reasons (e.g., spousal support)

-   Most deductions are for expenses to earn income

    -   E.g., moving expenses, child care, union and professional dues, interest expenses
    -   Applies the tax only to the "net" additions to income after the expenses

## Deductions

-   Most others are to encourage saving

    -   E.g., RRSP contributions, registered pension plan contributions
    -   Tax is not paid on these amounts until withdrawn
    -   Most beneficial when people are in high tax brackets when income is earned, and lower ones when withdrawn

-   First home buyers plan is deductible **and** not taxed when withdrawn

    -   Encourages saving for first home purchase

-   Some savings plans are *not* tax deductible but interest grows tax free 

    - Tax Free Savings Plans 
    - Registered Education Savings Plans

## Deductions

-   Finally, some deductions exist for other reasons

    -   E.g., spousal support payments, child support payments
    -   These payments reduce the income of the payer, who is assumed to have greater ability to pay
    -   Support is included in the income of the receiver
    -   Recognizes who ultimately receives the income and consumes it

## Tax Credits

-   **Tax Credit**: An amount that can be subtracted from taxes owing to arrive at taxes payable

-   These are different from deductions

    -   Deductions reduce the income that is ultimately taxable
    -   Credits occur after taxes are calculated, and reduce the amount owed

-   There are two types:

    -   **Non-refundable tax credits**: Reduce taxes owing, but not below zero
    -   **Refundable tax credits**: Can reduce taxes owing below zero, resulting in a refund

-   There are many credits available for different purposes

    -   Encourage behaviour
    -   Recognize certain costs
    -   Equity considerations

## Tax Credits

-   Many credits are 15% of the eligible amount

    -   15% is the lowest federal tax rate
    -   So these credits reduce taxes by the same amount as if the eligible amount were deducted from income

-   Others are different amounts

    -   Charitable donations credit is much higher

## Tax Credits

-   Some notable credits are:

-   Basic personal amount credit

    -   All taxpayers get a credit on the first portion of their income
    -   Recognizes that everyone has some basic consumption needs

-   Age amount credit

    -   For seniors over age 65
    -   Recognizes higher costs of living for seniors

-   CPP and EI credit

    -   Recognizes that these amounts are expenses to earn income
    -   Argument could be made that this is better as a deduction

## Tax Credits

-   Medical expenses

    -   Recognizes that medical expenses are necessary consumption
    -   Only expenses above a certain threshold are eligible

-   Charitable donations

    -   Encourages charitable giving
    -   Credit rate increases for donations above certain levels

-   Canada Workers Benefit

    -   A refundable credit for low-income workers
    -   Encourages work and supplements income for low earners

## Tax Credits

-   Boutique credits

    -   Targeted at specific groups or behaviours
    -   E.g., credits for digital news subscriptions, home accessibility, volunteer firefighters, fitness
    -   Often criticized for complexity and inequity

-   GST/HST credit

    -   A refundable credit to offset sales taxes paid
    -   Targeted at low and moderate income households

-   Tuition credit

    -   For students to offset costs of education
    -   Unused amounts can be carried forward or transferred to others

## Credits, Deductions, and Prices

-   One effect of deductions and credits is to alter prices for certain types of consumption

-   A good example is charitable donations

-   In Ontario, for a \$100 donation you would receive a federal credit of \$15 and a provincial credit of \$5.05

    -   Total credit of \$20.05
    -   So the effective "price" of a \$100 donation is \$79.95 after tax savings

-   In the United States, donors receive a deduction rather than a credit

    -   A \$100 donation would reduce taxable income by \$100
    -   The reduction in the price of the donation depends on the donor's tax bracket
    -   Someone in the 24% tax bracket avoids \$24 in taxes for the \$100 donation
    -   So the effective "price" of a \$100 donation is \$76 after tax savings
    -   Wealthier people (in higher brackets) pay a lower price for donations

## Credits vs Deductions: Fairness

-   Above example highlights a more general issue: benefits from deductions depend on tax bracket

    -   People in higher brackets receive more benefit from deductions than those in lower brackets
    -   Some view that as unfair

-   Many credits in Canada were deductions prior to 1988

    -   Converted to credits so that the benefit is the same for all taxpayers

-   Likely not optimal from an efficiency perspective

    -   People differ in their responses to prices
    -   You want to give larger incentives to those who respond more
    -   Credits do not do that

-   But credits are simpler and viewed as more equitable

## Tax Expenditures

-   Deductions and credits reduce taxes collected by the government

    -   Foregone tax revenue
    -   Money that is not available to fund public services

-   These can be substantial amounts of money

-   This reduction in taxes is viewed as a form of indirect government spending called **tax expenditures**

## Tax Expenditures

![](images/clipboard-988257517.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

## Tax Expenditures

-   The Canadian government tracks tax expenditures and reports them annually

    -   Current and historical reports here: https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/services/publications/federal-tax-expenditures.html

-   In 2025, projected to be \$183 billion federally (6% of GDP)

    -   Biggest items: pension deduction, partial inclusion of capital gains, zero-rating of groceries

# Personal Tax Rates in Canada

## Introduction

-   Canada has a progressive tax system

    -   Higher income earners pay a larger fraction of their income in taxes

-   Uses a bracket system

    -   Ranges of income where a particular tax rate applies

-   The tax you pay on an additional dollar of income is called the **marginal tax rate**

    -   Important for understanding incentives to work, save, invest
    -   Different from the **average tax rate** which is total taxes paid divided by total income

-   The rate in a particular bracket is the marginal tax rate on each dollar in the bracket

## Federal and Provincial Rates

![](images/clipboard-779599886.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

## Federal and Provincial Rates

![](images/clipboard-4098139174.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

## Statutory vs Effective Marginal Taxes

-   The rates shown are **statutory marginal tax rates**

    -   The rates specified in the tax code

-   But earning one dollar more income can affect other government programs that affect how much of that dollar you keep

    -   E.g., eligibility for benefits, credits, social assistance
    -   These changes can act like a tax or subsidy on additional income

-   The total effect is called the **effective marginal tax rate**

    -   Statutory rate plus any changes in benefits/credits/social assistance

## Statutory vs Effective Marginal Taxes

-   Several factors can drive a wedge between statutory and effective marginal tax rates

    -   Surtaxes: additional taxes applied when income exceeds certain thresholds

        -   Canada has mostly eliminated these, but some provinces still have them

    -   Payroll taxes: taxes on earnings to fund social programs (e.g., CPP, EI)

        -   These increase the effective marginal tax rate on labour income

    -   Clawbacks: as income increases, eligibility for certain programs decreases

        -   E.g., GST/HST credit, Canada Child Benefit, Old Age Security

-   What matters for individual decision making is the effective marginal tax rate

![](images/clipboard-3611731019.jpeg){fig-align="center"}


## Alternative Minimum Tax

- With the myriad of deductions and credits, it is possible to pay little or no tax despite high income

    - Wealthier people can hire accountants to find ways to reduce tax liability
    
    
-   Canada has an **Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)** to ensure high-income earners pay a minimum level of tax

- To calculate AMT, taxpayers add back certain deductions and credits to their taxable income

- Applies the normal tax rates to this adjusted income to calculate a minimum tax liability


## Effective vs Statutory Taxes Again

- We already discussed the differences between statutory and effective marginal tax rates

- This discussion can be broadened to consider these economic factors

    - The economic incidence of a tax is not always on the person who writes the cheque to the government
    - Taxes involve excess burden (deadweight loss) beyond the tax revenue collected

- Simply looking at the statutory tax rates ignores these factors

- Some economists have proposed a **flat tax** as a way to simplify the tax system and reduce excess burden

    - A single tax rate on all income, with few deductions or credits
    - Would reduce compliance costs and economic distortions


## Effective vs Statutory Taxes Again

- Pros of a flat tax would be

    - Simplicity: easier to understand and comply with
    - Lower compliance costs: less time and money spent on tax preparation
    - Reduced economic distortions: fewer incentives to alter behaviour to avoid tax
    
- Cons are

    - Equity concerns: flat tax is less progressive, may increase inequality
    - Some deductions and credits might be eliminated to broaden the tax base
    - Political feasibility: difficult to implement due to vested interests in current system


# Tax Unit

## Introduction

- The current tax unit in Canada is the individual

    - Each person files their own tax return
    - Income and taxes are calculated separately for each person
    - Some tax incentives exist for families 
    
- Some countries use the family or household as the tax unit

    - Income and taxes are calculated for the family as a whole
    - Can lead to different tax liabilities compared to individual filing
    
- Which is the better approach?
