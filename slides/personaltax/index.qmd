# Goals of This Section

## Goals of This Section

-   Outline history of personal income taxes in Canada

-   Describe how taxes are calculated

-   Discuss different concepts of income

-   Discuss tax rates

-   Explore other issues in income taxation

# History

## Origins

-   Income tax first introduced federally in Canada in 1917 to help finance WWI

    -   Initially a temporary measure, but became permanent in 1949

-   Provinces began introducing income taxes earlier, in the late 1800s (BC, PEI)

    -   Most others followed after the Great Depression
    -   Newfoundland was last to introduce income tax in 1949

-   Currently, both federal and provincial governments levy personal income taxes

    -   Authority comes from Constitution Act

## Other Details

-   Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) administers federal and most provincial income taxes

    -   Quebec administers its own provincial income tax

-   Because of this integration, people fill out one tax return for both federal and provincial taxes

    -   Except in Quebec, where two returns are filed

-   Up to 2000 provincial taxes operated on a "tax on tax" system

    -   Provincial taxes were a fraction of federal taxes owed

-   Since then provinces have moved to a "tax on income" system

    -   Provincial taxes are calculated on income before federal taxes are deducted

## Other Details

-   System based on self-assessment

    -   Taxpayers are responsible for reporting their income and calculating their taxes owed

-   Taxpayers have until April 30 of the following year to file their tax returns

    -   Penalties apply if taxes are owed

-   If you don't earn income, you don't have to file a tax return

    -   But strong incentive to file to claim benefits or credits
    -   About 12% of working age Canadians do not file a tax return

# Computing Personal Income Tax

## Tax Forms

-   The computation of your tax liability can be complicated

    -   Income comes from many sources
    -   Many deductions and credits are available

-   The CRA provides tax forms to help you compute your taxes

    -   Forms are available online or in paper format
    -   Many people use tax software to help with the process

-   The main federal tax form is the T1

    -   There are many additional forms (schedules) for specific types of income or deductions
    -   These forms are federal and provincial

-   Packages available here: <https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years.html>

## Calculating Taxes

-   The tax forms guide you through a series of steps to calculate your taxes

-   The process is algorithmic, and can be summarized in six main steps outlined in the next slides

-   Some key things to note

    -   Not all income sources are taxable
        -   Gifts, inheritances, lottery winnings, strike pay, legal settlements, first nations income on reserve, capital gains on principal residence, refundable tax credits are not taxable
    -   Not all income from taxable sources is subject to tax
        -   Certain income is deducted
        -   Deductions happen for different reasons
    -   Taxes are remitted to the government through withholding at source
        -   So at end of the year you pay the difference or get a refund

# Concepts of Income

## Haig-Simons Income

-   No definition of income in the Income Tax Act

-   **Haig-Simons definition** is often used in public finance

    -   Net increase in ability to consume during a period
    -   Income = Consumption + Additions to Net Wealth

-   Includes actual and potential increase in consumption ability

    -   E.g., unrealized capital gains are included

-   Also means decreases in consumption ability are negative income

    -   E.g., losses on investments are deductible

## Included Items

-   Employer pension contributions

    -   Adds to pension fund
    -   Increases ability to consume (in the future)

-   Transfer payments

    -   Retirement benefits, unemployment insurance, social assistance, workers' compensation
    -   All increase ability to consume

-   Capital gains/losses

    -   Increase in wealth from assets
    -   Realized (value gained after sale) and unrealized (value held prior to sale) gains
    -   Increases ability to consume
    -   Losses deducted because they decrease ability to consume

## Included Items

-   In-kind income

    -   Income received as goods/services rather than cash
    -   Employer perks (e.g., company car, subsidized housing)
    -   Free tuition for dependents of university employees
    -   Imputed rent from owner-occupied housing

-   Gifts and inheritances

    -   Increase wealth and ability to consume
    -   Not currently included in income for tax purposes in Canada (but is elsewhere, e.g., US)

## Problems with Haig-Simons

-   This concept of income is sometimes hard to implement in practice.

-   Business expenses

    -   Supposed to be expenses incurred to earn income
    -   Some expenses are part consumption part part business
        -   E.g., meals, travel, home office expenses

-   Capital gains/losses

    -   Sometimes hard to measure
    -   Easy for financial assets traded on markets
    -   Hard for other assets
        -   Cars, wine, jewelry, art, collectibles
        -   Cryptocurrencies and NFTs

## Problems with Haig-Simons

-   Imputed rent

    -   Hard to measure
    -   Varies by location, type of housing, size, amenities
    -   Also applies to non-housing assets that might be rented

-   In-kind income

    -   Markets exist for some of these, but not for others
    -   Household labour, volunteer work, parenting, merchandise discounts, etc. are hard to value

## Why Public Economists Use Haig-Simons

-   Haig-Simons income is a comprehensive measure of ability to pay

    -   Includes all sources of consumption and accumulation
    -   Forms a good base on which to tax individuals
    -   It is "fair" in that it captures all sources of income

-   Horizontal and vertical equity

    -   We noted that people with the same ability to pay should pay the same amount of tax
    -   People with greater ability to pay should pay more tax
    -   Basing it on this definition uses all income as basis for ability to pay

-   Efficiency

    -   Treats all forms of income the same
    -   No incentives to alter behaviour to avoid tax

## Income in Canada's Tax System

-   Much of the income counted in personal income taxes alights with Haig-Simons

-   But there are some departures

    -   Some income sources are excluded (e.g., gifts, inheritances, lottery winnings, employer contributions to benefits)
    -   Some income sources are only partially included (e.g., capital gains)
    -   Some deductions are allowed that do not fit the concept (e.g., RRSP contributions)

-   Capital gains are a notable departure

    -   Only 50% of capital gains are included in income
    -   Gains on principal residences are not counted at all
    -   In the past there were large gains exemptions (i.e. gains below exemption not taxed)
    -   Only realized gains are taxed

## Income in Canada's Tax System

-   These departures can lead to differences in asset value over time

-   To see this with realized vs unrealized gains, consider this example

    -   A person buys an asset for \$100
    -   It appreciates in value by 20% per year over the next 5 years
    -   Asset is sold at the end of year 5
    -   Assume a 50% tax rate and an inclusion rate of 50%
    -   We will go over the tax implications of taxing realized versus unrealized gains

## Income in Canada's Tax System

-   Table below illustrates taxation on **realized gains**

| Year | Start Year Value |  Gain | Taxable Gain |  Tax | End Year Value |
|------|-----------------:|------:|-------------:|-----:|---------------:|
| 1    |           100.00 | 20.00 |         0.00 | 0.00 |         120.00 |
| 2    |           120.00 | 24.00 |         0.00 | 0.00 |         144.00 |
| 3    |           144.00 | 28.80 |         0.00 | 0.00 |         172.80 |
| 4    |           172.80 | 34.56 |         0.00 | 0.00 |         207.36 |
| 5    |           207.36 | 41.47 |         0.00 | 0.00 |         248.83 |

-   At the end of the 5 years, the gain is \$248.83 - \$100 = \$148.83
-   Tax paid is \$148.83 \* 50% \* 50% = \$37.21
-   After- tax value is \$248.83 - \$37.21 = \$211.62
- After tax gain is \$111.62

## Income in Canada's Tax System

-   Table below illustrates taxation on **unrealized gains**

| Year | Start Year Value |  Gain | Taxable Gain |  Tax | End Year Value |
|------|-----------------:|------:|-------------:|-----:|---------------:|
| 1    |           100.00 | 20.00 |        10.00 | 5.00 |         115.00 |
| 2    |           115.00 | 23.00 |        11.50 | 5.75 |         132.25 |
| 3    |           132.25 | 26.45 |        13.23 | 6.61 |         152.09 |
| 4    |           152.09 | 30.42 |        15.21 | 7.60 |         174.90 |
| 5    |           174.90 | 34.98 |        17.49 | 8.75 |         201.14 |

-   Now the value at the end of year 5 is \$201.14
- After-tax gain is \$201.14 - \$100 = \$101.14
-  Total gains are \$20 + \$23 + \$26.45 + \$30.42 + \$34.98 = \$134.85
-   Tax paid is \$5.00 + \$5.75 + \$6.61 + \$7.60 + \$8.75 = \$134.85 * 50% \* 50% = \$33.71
    -   Less because the gains are smaller
    

## Income in Canada's Tax System

- Taxation of realized gains locks in investments

  - People may be reluctant to sell assets to avoid paying tax
  
- This can lead to inefficiencies in the economy

  - People hold onto assets that are not the best use of their resources
  - Capital is not allocated to its most productive use
  
- Conservatives proposed an deferral of taxation for investing in Canadian companies

  - No gains tax if reinvested in Canadian companies
  - Aimed at reducing lock-in effect and encouraging investment in Canada


## Income in Canada's Tax System

- What if a person holds unrealized gains at death?

  - CRA deems gains realized on date of death
  - Taxes are owed by the estate
  - If assets are bequeathed to someone else, the change in asset value since date of death is subject to gains tax
  
- Why preferential treatment of capital gains?

  - Encourages investment and risk-taking
  - Compensates for deferring consumption
  - Offsets increased tax burden from inflation (nominal gains)
