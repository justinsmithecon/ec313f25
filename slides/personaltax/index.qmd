# Goals of This Section

## Goals of This Section

-   Outline history of personal income taxes in Canada

-   Describe how taxes are calculated

-   Discuss different concepts of income

-   Discuss tax rates

-   Explore other issues in income taxation

# History

## Origins

-   Income tax first introduced federally in Canada in 1917 to help finance WWI

    -   Initially a temporary measure, but became permanent in 1949

-   Provinces began introducing income taxes earlier, in the late 1800s (BC, PEI)

    -   Most others followed after the Great Depression
    -   Newfoundland was last to introduce income tax in 1949

-   Currently, both federal and provincial governments levy personal income taxes

    -   Authority comes from Constitution Act

## Revenues

## Other Details

-   Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) administers federal and most provincial income taxes

    -   Quebec administers its own provincial income tax

-   Because of this integration, people fill out one tax return for both federal and provincial taxes

    -   Except in Quebec, where two returns are filed

-   Up to 2000 provincial taxes operated on a "tax on tax" system

    -   Provincial taxes were a fraction of federal taxes owed

-   Since then provinces have moved to a "tax on income" system

    -   Provincial taxes are calculated on income before federal taxes are deducted

## Other Details

-   System based on self-assessment

    -   Taxpayers are responsible for reporting their income and calculating their taxes owed

-   Taxpayers have until April 30 of the following year to file their tax returns

    -   Penalties apply if taxes are owed

-   If you don't earn income, you don't have to file a tax return

    -   But strong incentive to file to claim benefits or credits
    -   About 12% of working age Canadians do not file a tax return

# Computing Personal Income Tax

## Tax Forms

-   The computation of your tax liability can be complicated

    -   Income comes from many sources
    -   Many deductions and credits are available

-   The CRA provides tax forms to help you compute your taxes

    -   Forms are available online or in paper format
    -   Many people use tax software to help with the process

-   The main federal tax form is the T1

    -   There are many additional forms (schedules) for specific types of income or deductions
    -   These forms are federal and provincial

-   Packages available here: <https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years.html>

## Calculating Taxes

-   The tax forms guide you through a series of steps to calculate your taxes

-   The process is algorithmic, and can be summarized in six main steps outlined in the next slides

-   Some key things to note

    -   Not all income sources are taxable
        -   Gifts, inheritances, lottery winnings, strike pay, legal settlements, first nations income on reserve, capital gains on principal residence, refundable tax credits are not taxable
    -   Not all income from taxable sources is subject to tax
        -   Certain income is deducted
        -   Deductions happen for different reasons
    -   Taxes are remitted to the government through withholding at source
        -   So at end of the year you pay the difference or get a refund

# Concepts of Income

## Haig-Simons Income

-   No definition of income in the Income Tax Act

-   **Haig-Simons definition** is often used in public finance

    -   Net increase in ability to consume during a period
    -   Income = Consumption + Additions to Net Wealth

-   Includes actual and potential increase in consumption ability

    -   E.g., unrealized capital gains are included

-   Also means decreases in consumption ability are negative income

    -   E.g., losses on investments are deductible

## Included Items

-   Employer pension contributions

    -   Adds to pension fund
    -   Increases ability to consume (in the future)

-   Transfer payments

    -   Retirement benefits, unemployment insurance, social assistance, workers' compensation
    -   All increase ability to consume

-   Capital gains/losses

    -   Increase in wealth from assets
    -   Realized (value gained after sale) and unrealized (value held prior to sale) gains
    -   Increases ability to consume
    -   Losses deducted because they decrease ability to consume

## Included Items

-   In-kind income

    -   Income received as goods/services rather than cash
    -   Employer perks (e.g., company car, subsidized housing)
    -   Free tuition for dependents of university employees
    -   Imputed rent from owner-occupied housing

-   Gifts and inheritances

    -   Increase wealth and ability to consume
    -   Not currently included in income for tax purposes in Canada (but is elsewhere, e.g., US)

## Problems with Haig-Simons

-   This concept of income is sometimes hard to implement in practice.

-   Business expenses

    -   Supposed to be expenses incurred to earn income
    -   Some expenses are part consumption part part business
        -   E.g., meals, travel, home office expenses

-   Capital gains/losses

    -   Sometimes hard to measure
    -   Easy for financial assets traded on markets
    -   Hard for other assets
        -   Cars, wine, jewelry, art, collectibles
        -   Cryptocurrencies and NFTs

## Problems with Haig-Simons

-   Imputed rent

    -   Hard to measure
    -   Varies by location, type of housing, size, amenities
    -   Also applies to non-housing assets that might be rented

-   In-kind income

    -   Markets exist for some of these, but not for others
    -   Household labour, volunteer work, parenting, merchandise discounts, etc. are hard to value

## Why Public Economists Use Haig-Simons

-   Haig-Simons income is a comprehensive measure of ability to pay

    -   Includes all sources of consumption and accumulation
    -   Forms a good base on which to tax individuals
    -   It is "fair" in that it captures all sources of income

-   Horizontal and vertical equity

    -   We noted that people with the same ability to pay should pay the same amount of tax
    -   People with greater ability to pay should pay more tax
    -   Basing it on this definition uses all income as basis for ability to pay

-   Efficiency

    -   Treats all forms of income the same
    -   No incentives to alter behaviour to avoid tax

## Income in Canada's Tax System

-   Much of the income counted in personal income taxes aligns with Haig-Simons

-   But there are some departures

    -   Some income sources are excluded (e.g., gifts, inheritances, lottery winnings, employer contributions to benefits)
    -   Some income sources are only partially included (e.g., capital gains)
    -   Some deductions are allowed that do not fit the concept (e.g., RRSP contributions)

-   Capital gains are a notable departure

    -   Only 50% of capital gains are included in income
    -   Gains on principal residences are not counted at all
    -   In the past there were large gains exemptions (i.e. gains below exemption not taxed)
    -   Only realized gains are taxed

## Income in Canada's Tax System

-   These departures can lead to differences in asset value over time

-   To see this with realized vs unrealized gains, consider this example

    -   A person buys an asset for \$100
    -   It appreciates in value by 20% per year over the next 5 years
    -   Asset is sold at the end of year 5
    -   Assume a 50% tax rate and an inclusion rate of 50%
    -   We will go over the tax implications of taxing realized versus unrealized gains

## Income in Canada's Tax System

-   Table below illustrates taxation on **realized gains**

| Year | Start Year Value |  Gain | Taxable Gain |  Tax | End Year Value |
|------|-----------------:|------:|-------------:|-----:|---------------:|
| 1    |           100.00 | 20.00 |         0.00 | 0.00 |         120.00 |
| 2    |           120.00 | 24.00 |         0.00 | 0.00 |         144.00 |
| 3    |           144.00 | 28.80 |         0.00 | 0.00 |         172.80 |
| 4    |           172.80 | 34.56 |         0.00 | 0.00 |         207.36 |
| 5    |           207.36 | 41.47 |         0.00 | 0.00 |         248.83 |

-   At the end of the 5 years, the gain is \$248.83 - \$100 = \$148.83
-   Tax paid is \$148.83 \* 50% \* 50% = \$37.21
-   After- tax value is \$248.83 - \$37.21 = \$211.62
-   After tax gain is \$111.62

## Income in Canada's Tax System

-   Table below illustrates taxation on **unrealized gains**

| Year | Start Year Value |  Gain | Taxable Gain |  Tax | End Year Value |
|------|-----------------:|------:|-------------:|-----:|---------------:|
| 1    |           100.00 | 20.00 |        10.00 | 5.00 |         115.00 |
| 2    |           115.00 | 23.00 |        11.50 | 5.75 |         132.25 |
| 3    |           132.25 | 26.45 |        13.23 | 6.61 |         152.09 |
| 4    |           152.09 | 30.42 |        15.21 | 7.60 |         174.90 |
| 5    |           174.90 | 34.98 |        17.49 | 8.75 |         201.14 |

-   Now the value at the end of year 5 is \$201.14
-   After-tax gain is \$201.14 - \$100 = \$101.14
-   Total gains are \$20 + \$23 + \$26.45 + \$30.42 + \$34.98 = \$134.85
-   Tax paid is \$5.00 + \$5.75 + \$6.61 + \$7.60 + \$8.75 = \$134.85 \* 50% \* 50% = \$33.71
    -   Less because the gains are smaller

## Income in Canada's Tax System

-   Taxation of realized gains locks in investments

    -   People may be reluctant to sell assets to avoid paying tax

-   This can lead to inefficiencies in the economy

    -   People hold onto assets that are not the best use of their resources
    -   Capital is not allocated to its most productive use

-   Conservatives proposed an deferral of taxation for investing in Canadian companies

    -   No gains tax if reinvested in Canadian companies
    -   Aimed at reducing lock-in effect and encouraging investment in Canada

## Income in Canada's Tax System

-   What if a person holds unrealized gains at death?

    -   CRA deems gains realized on date of death
    -   Taxes are owed by the estate
    -   If assets are bequeathed to someone else, the change in asset value since date of death is subject to gains tax

-   Why preferential treatment of capital gains?

    -   Encourages investment and risk-taking
    -   Compensates for deferring consumption
    -   Offsets increased tax burden from inflation (nominal gains)

## Income in Canada's Tax System

-   Contributions to pension plans (employee and employer) are not included in income until paid out

    -   Allows people to defer taxes until retirement

        -   Beneficial if people are in lower tax brackets when retired

    -   Interest also not taxed until withdrawn\

    -   Encourages saving for retirement

    -   But a departure from Haig-Simons definition of income

-   Finally gifts and inheritances are not taxed

    -   By Haig-Simons, they should be included in income because they increase ability to consume

# Tax Deductions and Credits

## Introduction

-   We discussed how income is calculated for tax purposes

-   There is a difference between

    -   Total income and taxable income

        -   **Deductions** exclude some income from being taxed

    -   Taxes owing and taxes payable

        -   **Credits** reduce taxes owing

-   There are various reasons for deductions and credits

    -   Social policy goals
    -   Economic efficiency
    -   Equity considerations

## Deductions

-   **Tax Deduction**: An amount that can be subtracted from total income to arrive at taxable income

-   In Canada, the main goals of deductions are to

    -   Recognize certain unavoidable expenses to earn income (e.g., child care, moving expenses)
    -   Encourage certain behaviours (e.g., saving for retirement, a home)
    -   Other reasons (e.g., spousal support)

-   Most deductions are for expenses to earn income

    -   E.g., moving expenses, child care, union and professional dues, interest expenses
    -   Applies the tax only to the "net" additions to income after the expenses

## Deductions

-   Most others are to encourage saving

    -   E.g., RRSP contributions, registered pension plan contributions
    -   Tax is not paid on these amounts until withdrawn
    -   Most beneficial when people are in high tax brackets when income is earned, and lower ones when withdrawn

-   First home buyers plan is deductible **and** not taxed when withdrawn

    -   Encourages saving for first home purchase

-   Some savings plans are *not* tax deductible but interest grows tax free

    -   Tax Free Savings Plans
    -   Registered Education Savings Plans

## Deductions

-   Finally, some deductions exist for other reasons

    -   E.g., spousal support payments, child support payments
    -   These payments reduce the income of the payer, who is assumed to have greater ability to pay
    -   Support is included in the income of the receiver
    -   Recognizes who ultimately receives the income and consumes it

## Tax Credits

-   **Tax Credit**: An amount that can be subtracted from taxes owing to arrive at taxes payable

-   These are different from deductions

    -   Deductions reduce the income that is ultimately taxable
    -   Credits occur after taxes are calculated, and reduce the amount owed

-   There are two types:

    -   **Non-refundable tax credits**: Reduce taxes owing, but not below zero
    -   **Refundable tax credits**: Can reduce taxes owing below zero, resulting in a refund

-   There are many credits available for different purposes

    -   Encourage behaviour
    -   Recognize certain costs
    -   Equity considerations

## Tax Credits

-   Many credits are 15% of the eligible amount

    -   15% is the lowest federal tax rate
    -   So these credits reduce taxes by the same amount as if the eligible amount were deducted from income

-   Others are different amounts

    -   Charitable donations credit is much higher

## Tax Credits

-   Some notable credits are:

-   Basic personal amount credit

    -   All taxpayers get a credit on the first portion of their income
    -   Recognizes that everyone has some basic consumption needs

-   Age amount credit

    -   For seniors over age 65
    -   Recognizes higher costs of living for seniors

-   CPP and EI credit

    -   Recognizes that these amounts are expenses to earn income
    -   Argument could be made that this is better as a deduction

## Tax Credits

-   Medical expenses

    -   Recognizes that medical expenses are necessary consumption
    -   Only expenses above a certain threshold are eligible

-   Charitable donations

    -   Encourages charitable giving
    -   Credit rate increases for donations above certain levels

-   Canada Workers Benefit

    -   A refundable credit for low-income workers
    -   Encourages work and supplements income for low earners

## Tax Credits

-   Boutique credits

    -   Targeted at specific groups or behaviours
    -   E.g., credits for digital news subscriptions, home accessibility, volunteer firefighters, fitness
    -   Often criticized for complexity and inequity

-   GST/HST credit

    -   A refundable credit to offset sales taxes paid
    -   Targeted at low and moderate income households

-   Tuition credit

    -   For students to offset costs of education
    -   Unused amounts can be carried forward or transferred to others

## Credits, Deductions, and Prices

-   One effect of deductions and credits is to alter prices for certain types of consumption

-   A good example is charitable donations

-   In Ontario, for a \$100 donation you would receive a federal credit of \$15 and a provincial credit of \$5.05

    -   Total credit of \$20.05
    -   So the effective "price" of a \$100 donation is \$79.95 after tax savings

-   In the United States, donors receive a deduction rather than a credit

    -   A \$100 donation would reduce taxable income by \$100
    -   The reduction in the price of the donation depends on the donor's tax bracket
    -   Someone in the 24% tax bracket avoids \$24 in taxes for the \$100 donation
    -   So the effective "price" of a \$100 donation is \$76 after tax savings
    -   Wealthier people (in higher brackets) pay a lower price for donations

## Credits vs Deductions: Fairness

-   Above example highlights a more general issue: benefits from deductions depend on tax bracket

    -   People in higher brackets receive more benefit from deductions than those in lower brackets
    -   Some view that as unfair

-   Many credits in Canada were deductions prior to 1988

    -   Converted to credits so that the benefit is the same for all taxpayers

-   Likely not optimal from an efficiency perspective

    -   People differ in their responses to prices
    -   You want to give larger incentives to those who respond more
    -   Credits do not do that

-   But credits are simpler and viewed as more equitable

## Tax Expenditures

-   Deductions and credits reduce taxes collected by the government

    -   Foregone tax revenue
    -   Money that is not available to fund public services

-   These can be substantial amounts of money

-   This reduction in taxes is viewed as a form of indirect government spending called **tax expenditures**

## Tax Expenditures

![](images/clipboard-988257517.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

## Tax Expenditures

-   The Canadian government tracks tax expenditures and reports them annually

    -   Current and historical reports here: https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/services/publications/federal-tax-expenditures.html

-   In 2025, projected to be \$183 billion federally (6% of GDP)

    -   Biggest items: pension deduction, partial inclusion of capital gains, zero-rating of groceries

# Personal Tax Rates in Canada

## Introduction

-   Canada has a progressive tax system

    -   Higher income earners pay a larger fraction of their income in taxes

-   Uses a bracket system

    -   Ranges of income where a particular tax rate applies

-   The tax you pay on an additional dollar of income is called the **marginal tax rate**

    -   Important for understanding incentives to work, save, invest
    -   Different from the **average tax rate** which is total taxes paid divided by total income

-   The rate in a particular bracket is the marginal tax rate on each dollar in the bracket

## Federal and Provincial Rates

![](images/clipboard-779599886.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

## Federal and Provincial Rates

![](images/clipboard-4098139174.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

## Statutory vs Effective Marginal Taxes

-   The rates shown are **statutory marginal tax rates**

    -   The rates specified in the tax code

-   But earning one dollar more income can affect other government programs that affect how much of that dollar you keep

    -   E.g., eligibility for benefits, credits, social assistance
    -   These changes can act like a tax or subsidy on additional income

-   The total effect is called the **effective marginal tax rate**

    -   Statutory rate plus any changes in benefits/credits/social assistance

## Statutory vs Effective Marginal Taxes

-   Several factors can drive a wedge between statutory and effective marginal tax rates

    -   Surtaxes: additional taxes applied when income exceeds certain thresholds

        -   Canada has mostly eliminated these, but some provinces still have them

    -   Payroll taxes: taxes on earnings to fund social programs (e.g., CPP, EI)

        -   These increase the effective marginal tax rate on labour income

    -   Clawbacks: as income increases, eligibility for certain programs decreases

        -   E.g., GST/HST credit, Canada Child Benefit, Old Age Security

-   What matters for individual decision making is the effective marginal tax rate

## Statutory vs Effective Marginal Taxes

## Statutory vs Effective Marginal Taxes

![](images/clipboard-3611731019.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

## Alternative Minimum Tax

-   With the myriad of deductions and credits, it is possible to pay little or no tax despite high income

    -   Wealthier people can hire accountants to find ways to reduce tax liability

-   Canada has an **Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)** to ensure high-income earners pay a minimum level of tax

-   To calculate AMT, taxpayers add back certain deductions and credits to their taxable income

-   Applies the normal tax rates to this adjusted income to calculate a minimum tax liability

## Effective vs Statutory Taxes Again

-   We already discussed the differences between statutory and effective marginal tax rates

-   This discussion can be broadened to consider these economic factors

    -   The economic incidence of a tax is not always on the person who writes the cheque to the government
    -   Taxes involve excess burden (deadweight loss) beyond the tax revenue collected

-   Simply looking at the statutory tax rates ignores these factors

-   Some economists have proposed a **flat tax** as a way to simplify the tax system and reduce excess burden

    -   A single tax rate on all income, with few deductions or credits
    -   Would reduce compliance costs and economic distortions

## Effective vs Statutory Taxes Again

-   Pros of a flat tax would be

    -   Simplicity: easier to understand and comply with
    -   Lower compliance costs: less time and money spent on tax preparation
    -   Reduced economic distortions: fewer incentives to alter behaviour to avoid tax

-   Cons are

    -   Equity concerns: flat tax is less progressive, may increase inequality
    -   Some deductions and credits might be eliminated to broaden the tax base
    -   Political feasibility: difficult to implement due to vested interests in current system

# Tax Unit

## Introduction

-   The current tax unit in Canada is the individual

    -   Each person files their own tax return
    -   Income and taxes are calculated separately for each person
    -   Some tax incentives exist for families

-   Some countries use the family or household as the tax unit

    -   Income and taxes are calculated for the family as a whole
    -   Can lead to different tax liabilities compared to individual filing

-   Which is the better approach?

## Individual vs Family as Tax Unit

-   Individual filing is when each person files their own tax return

    -   Even in couples, each income is taxed separately
    -   Means that deductions and credits are calculated for each person individually
    -   Though sometimes deductions and credits can be shifted between spouses

-   Family filing is when the family unit files a single tax return

    -   Income is combined and taxed as a whole
    -   Deductions and credits are calculated for the family as a whole

## Individual vs Family as Tax Unit

-   Next slide outlines an example showing difference for two types of families

    -   A breadwinner family where one spouse earns most income

    -   One where both spouses earn equal amounts

-   Hypothetical progressive tax schedule is

    -   10% tax up to \$6000 in income

    -   50% tax for income beyond \$6000

![](images/ros55466_t1707.jpg){fig-align="center"}


## Individual vs Family as Tax Unit

-   With joint filing, it does not matter who earns income

    -   Tax applies to the sum of the income, so who earns it is irrelevant
    -   Both families pay the same tax

-   With individual filing, it does

    -   In example, one spouse earns almost all income
    -   Means that more income is taxed at higher rates
    -   Leads to higher burden
    -   Means the two families pay different tax

-   For both families, joint filing increases the tax burden

## Individual vs Family as Tax Unit

-   Efficiency issues with the family as the taxable unit

    -   With family as the taxable unity, everyone in the family pays the same marginal tax rate
    -   Recall that using a Ramsay Rule argument, we want to tax labour differently depending on elasticity of supply
    -   Using family as the tax unit means that people with different elasticities may face the same marginal tax rate

-   Equity issues with family taxation

    -   Some people believe that tax burdens should be equal across families

    -   But taxing as a family can discourage work by the lower earning spouse

        -   As noted, second earner faces higher marginal tax rates than if taxed individually
        -   The lower earner in many families is female
        -   Could discourage female labour supply

    -   Some types of families may not actually share income

## Individual vs Family as Tax Unit

-   Equity issues with the individual as the filing unit

    -   Families who earn the same amount are taxed differently

    -   Income splitting with individual filing

        -   In Canada this happens with Canadian-Controlled Private Corporations (CCPCs)
        -   Professionals like doctors, dentists, etc can incorporate
        -   Inside a CCCP, income is split among family members through "income sprinkling"
        -   Allows wealthy to lower their tax burden

-   Other issues

    -   What is a family?

        -   Married couples, common-law partners, single parents, multi-generational households?

# Taxes and Inflation

## Introduction

-   Inflation is the general increase in prices in the economy

-   Nominal wages and asset prices tend to rise with inflation

    -   Some wage contracts are directly indexed to inflation

-   But income taxes are based on nominal income

-   This can lead to some problems in the tax system

## Bracket Creep

-   In a progressive tax system, there are different marginal tax rates for different ranges on incomes

-   As nominal incomes rise with inflation, people can be pushed into higher tax brackets

    -   Even if their real income (purchasing power) has not increased

-   Example

    -   Suppose tax on first \$6000 of income is 10%, and income above \$6000 is taxed at 50%
    -   In 2024, a person earns \$6000 and pays \$600 in taxes
    -   Suppose that between 2024 and 2025 there is 10% inflation, and the person's nominal income rises to \$6600
    -   Now the person pays \$600 + 0.5 \* (\$6600 - \$6000) = \$900 in taxes
    -   But their real income is the same

-   The movement into higher tax brackets due to inflation is called **bracket creep**

## Bracket Creep

-   To avoid bracket creep, governments can index tax brackets to inflation

    -   Adjust the income thresholds for tax brackets based on inflation rate

-   But this only works with anticipated inflation

    -   Unanticipated inflation can still lead to bracket creep

-   Canada does adjust the brackets for inflation to avoid this problem

## Deductions and Credits

-   Some deductions and credits are fixed amounts

    -   E.g., basic personal amount, age amount, medical expenses threshold, child care deduction limit

-   These amounts may not be indexed to inflation

-   The real value of these deductions and credits erodes with inflation

    -   People may pay more taxes in real terms even if their real income has not increased

-   Example: child care deduction limit is \$8000 per child under 7

    -   If this stays constant over time, purchasing power of this deduction decreases with inflation

## Capital Income

-   We briefly discussed the issue of inflation and capital income

-   Assets grow with inflation

    -   Stocks, real estate, etc.

-   But when assets are sold, the capital gains tax is based on nominal gains

-   Means part of tax is based on inflation, part based on real gains

-   Example: An asset increases in nominal value by 5% in a year, and inflation is also 5%

    -   If a person sells the asset, capital gains tax is based on 5% nominal gain
    -   But their real gain is 0%
    -   Taxes based entirely on inflation

## Interest Income

-   Like with capital gains, interest income is taxed on nominal amounts

-   If you earn interest on a savings account, the interest is included in income

-   But part of that interest is just compensating for inflation

    -   Real return may be lower than nominal return

-   The real return on an investment is $r = i - \pi - ti$

    -   Where $i$ is the nominal interest rate, $\pi$ is the inflation rate, and $t$ is the tax rate on interest income

-   So a \$100 investment that earns 6% nominal interest with 3% inflation and a 50% tax rate has a real return of

    -   $r = 0.06 - 0.03 - 0.5*0.06 = 0$

## Solving The Inflation Problem

-   Main solution to brack creep and deduction/credit erosion is to index to inflation

    -   Canada has been partially indexing the personal income tax system since 1973
    -   Indexing has expanded over time
    -   Stil not all parts are indexed
    -   Remember also that unanticipated inflation can still cause problems

-   Tables on next slides outline the current state of indexing

## Solving The Inflation Problem

- There are also equity issues that are solved by indexing

- Without indexing, the value of tax credits erodes over time

  - Lower income people using more credits are disproportionately affected
  - The burden of inflation would be worse for them
  
- Indexing is important to maintain the real value of these income support measures


# International Income

## Introduction

- We have only talked about income earned within Canada

- Many Canadians earn income abroad

- Should Canada or the other country (or both) tax this income?

- Different countries take different approaches


## Taxation of Foreign Income in Canada

- Taxation in Canada is based on residency

- Residents of Canada pay tax on income earned worldwide

- To avoid double taxation, Canada offers a foreign income tax credit

  - Foreign tax paid lowers Canadian tax owed on that income
  - Credit can offset part or all of Canadian taxes
  - But Cannot exceed Canadian tax owed on that income
  
- In contrast, US citizens are taxed regardless of residency

  - US citizens pay tax on worldwide income even if they live abroad
  - Foreign tax credit also available to avoid double taxation

## Taxation of Foreign Income in Canada

- Is a residency-based system better than citizenship-based?

- Equity considerations

  - Residents of the same foreign country can be taxed differently based on citizenship
  
      - E.g. Canada versus US citizens living in the same foreign country
      
  - Citizens of the same country can be taxed differently based on residency
  
      - E.g. Canadian citizens living in Canada versus abroad
      
  - Different definitions of horizontal equity would make one more equitable
  
  
## Taxation of Foreign Income in Canada

- Efficiency considerations  

  - Taxes can affect decisions on production
  
      - American firms abroad may face higher taxes if owners are US citizens
      - Could discourage investment abroad
      - Canadian firms would not face this issue
      
  - Taxes can affect decisions on migration
  
      - US citizens face no tax advantage to moving abroad
      - Canadian citizens may face tax advantages to moving and residing abroad
