# Goals of This Section

## Goals of This Section

-   Define and discuss types of consumption taxes

-   Analyze the efficiency and equity implications of consumption taxes

-   Introduce and discuss value added taxes and retail sales taxes

-   Summarize Canada's consumption taxation

-   Compare consumption taxes to income taxes

# Overview

## Introduction

-   As we know, purchases of final goods are taxed

-   These taxes are called **consumption taxes**

-   There are several types charged depending on province of residence and the type of good or service purchased

    -   They have features that distinguish them from each other

-   In this section we outline the different types of taxes and discuss their merits

## Types of Consumption Taxes

-   Value Added Tax (VAT)

    -   Charged at each stage of production based on the value added at that stage
    -   Used globally for taxation of consumption

-   Retail Sales Tax (RST)

    -   Charged only at the point of sale to the final consumer
    -   Used in some provinces in Canada

-   Excise Taxes

    -   Charged on specific goods, often to discourage consumption (e.g., tobacco, alcohol)
    -   Used in all provinces in Canada and by federal government

-   Custom Duties (tariffs)

    -   Charged on goods imported into the country
    -   Used by federal government only

## Revenue from Consumption Taxes

# Reasons for Consumption Taxes

## Administrative Ease

-   Relative to other taxes, consumption taxes are easy to administer

-   Import duties are collected at the time of importation

    -   In the past, relatively few items were imported
    -   Much more now, but still straightforward to collect

-   Sales taxes are collected from retailers

    -   Lots of retailers to collect from, but less than for income tax

    -   Some complications can arise for taxable and non-taxable goods

        -   Example: Less than 6 baked goods at a time are taxable, but 6 or more is non-taxable
        -   Some basic groceries are zero rated

## Efficiency

-   Economists argue that consumption taxes are more efficient than income taxes

-   Because they do not distort savings behaviour

    -   Income taxes reduce the return to saving
    -   Consumption taxes do not affect the return to saving

-   Example on next slide illustrates this using two period model

    -   Assume individuals live for two periods
    -   One person earns income in period 1 and consumes it all
    -   Another person earns income in period 1, saves some, and consumes in period 2
    -   Tax rate on income is 50%, tax rate on consumption is 100%, and interest rate is 10%

## Efficiency

|  |  |  |  |  |
|----|----|----|----|----|
|  | **Inc Tax** | **Inc Tax** | **Cons Tax** | **Cons Tax** |
| **Item** | **Homer** | **Marge** | **Homer** | **Marge** |
| **Income in period 1** | 100.00 | 100.00 | 100.00 | 100.00 |
| **Taxes in period 1** | 50.00 | 50.00 | 50.00 | 26.19 |
| **Consumption in period 1** | 50.00 | 25.61 | 50.00 | 26.19 |
| **Savings in period 1** | 0.00 | 24.39 | 0.00 | 47.62 |
| **Interest earnings in period 2** | 0.00 | 2.44 | 0.00 | 4.76 |
| **Taxes in period 2** | 0.00 | 1.22 | 0.00 | 26.19 |
| **Consumption in period 2** | 0.00 | 25.61 | 0.00 | 26.19 |
| **PDV of taxes** | 50.00 | 51.11 | 50.00 | 50.00 |

## Efficiency

-   Under the income tax

    -   Saving is discouraged because the return is less

    -   Marge pays more in present discounted value of taxes (51.11) than Homer (50.00)

        -   So there is a lack of horizontal equity
        -   Marge and Homer are not taxed the same for the same lifetime income

-   Under the consumption tax

    -   Saving is not discouraged because the return is unaffected

    -   Marge and Homer pay the same present discounted value of taxes (50.00)

        -   So there is horizontal equity
        -   Marge and Homer are taxed the same for the same lifetime income

## Efficiency

-   There is still an excess burden from the consumption tax

    -   Consumption tax distorts choice between consumption and leisure
    -   People will substitute towards leisure, creating excess burden

-   Studies show that the consumption tax has lower excess burden than income tax

## Equity

-   Progressiveness: consumption taxes are often criticized for being regressive

    -   Lower income individuals spend a larger share of their annual income on consumption

    -   But, it is less regressive if we consider

        -   Lifetime income rather than annual income
        -   Tax credits and transfers that offset regressiveness

-   Gender: consumption tax incidents may not be gender neutral

    -   Some products targeted to women may have higher prices
    -   A tax levied on product prices may then have a higher incidence for women

## Equity

-   Ability to pay: taxes are levied on actual rather than potential consumption

    -   Targeted towards chosen spending patterns rather than ability to pay
    -   A penny-pinching rich person can pay less tax than a poor person

-   Annual versus lifetime equity: income taxes may generate different lifetime tax burdens

    -   Example we covered before with Homer and Marge
    -   Income taxes generated more tax for Marge because she saved
    -   Consumption taxes generate more even lifetime tax burden

# Value Added Taxes

## Introduction

-   Value Added Taxes (VAT) are the most common form of consumption tax globally

-   In Canada, the GST and HST are VATs

-   Prior to GST, Canada used a the Federal Sales Tax (FST)

    -   Sales tax charged at the manufacturing level

-   The FST had a number of problems

    -   Small tax base required high tax rates to collect enough revenue
    -   \*\* Tax Cascading\*\*: taxes charged on manufacturing inputs to other manufactured goods
        -   E.g., tax on steel used to make cars
        -   Taxes were charged on the steel and then again on the car
        -   Means taxes were charged on top of taxes

## Introduction

-   FST was also complex to administer

-   GST replaced FST in 1991

    -   Broader tax base allowed for lower tax rates
    -   Value added method of taxation eliminated tax cascading
    -   Input tax credits simplified administration for businesses

-   Original GST rate was 7%

    -   Lowered to 6% in 2006, and 5% in 2008

-   Replaced by HST in some provinces starting in 1997

    -   HST combines federal GST and provincial sales tax into single value added tax
    -   Current provinces usng HST are: NS, NB, NL, ON, PEI

## Introduction

-   BC had HST from 2010 to 2013

    -   Reverted back to separate GST and PST after a referendum

    -   Former premier Vander Zalm argued HST was a tax increase

        -   Tax applied to more goods and services than PST

## How Value Added Taxes Work

-   Production of a final good occurs in several stages

    -   At each stage, value is added to the good
    -   Value added is the difference between sales revenue and cost of inputs

-   Example: Production of a table

    -   Stage 1: Logger sells logs for \$100
        -   Value added = \$100 - \$0 = \$100
    -   Stage 2: Lumber mill buys logs for \$100, sells lumber for \$150
        -   Value added = \$150 - \$100 = \$50
    -   Stage 3: Furniture maker buys lumber for \$150, sells table for \$300
        -   Value added = \$300 - \$150 = \$150

## How Value Added Taxes Work

-   Taxes are levied on value added at each stage

-   Total tax is the sum of taxes at each stage

-   Equivalent to a single tax on the final sale price

-   Next slide has example of VAT

    -   Based on production of bread

## How Value Added Taxes Work

![](images/clipboard-1240629291.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

## How Value Added Taxes Work

-   How does government collect tax only on value added at each stage?

-   Uses an **invoice-credit method**

    -   At each stage firm pays tax on *total* sales
    -   But claims a credit for taxes paid by suppliers

-   Using the bread example:

    -   Farmer sells wheat for \$400, pays \$40 in tax
    -   Miller sells flour for \$700, pays \$70 in tax, claims \$40 credit, remits \$30
    -   Baker sells bread for \$950, pays \$95 in tax, claims \$70 credit, remits \$25
    -   Grocer sells breat for \$1000, pays \$100 in tax, claims \$95 credit, remits \$5

## Implementation Issues

-   Some issues make the administration more complex

    -   Some goods and services are zero rated from VAT

        -   Examples: basic food, prescriptiond drugs, medical devices

    -   Firms with annual sales below \$30,000 do not remit HST/GST

    -   Treatment of investment assets (e.g. machines)

        -   Not clear whether to include full value, depreciated value, or none of it to compute tax liability
        -   In Canada, usually none of it is included

## Implementation Issues

-   There is a difference between **zero-rated** and **exempt** goods/services

    -   Zero-rated: tax rate is 0%, firms can claim input tax credits
    -   Exempt: no tax charged, firms cannot claim input tax credits

-   If goods are exempt at retail stage, it appears the same

    -   No tax collected on both zero-rated and exempt goods/services

-   But there are implications for embedded taxes

    -   Exempt goods/services have embedded taxes that cannot be claimed back

## Implementation Issues

![](images/clipboard-609976475.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

## Efficiency

-   We have previously discussed efficient taxes

    -   Low excess burden, minimal distortions to behaviour

-   Is it inefficient to add a VAT when we already have income taxes?

    -   If income tax is already optimal, adding VAT creates distortions and inefficiencies
    -   If it is not optimal, VAT may improve efficiency by reducing income tax distortions

## Improvements to GST

-   Economists like VATs like GST, but citizens do not

-   There are ways to improve it

-   Harmonization

    -   The HST is an improvement over separate GST and PST
    -   Reduces compliance costs for businesses

-   Compliance costs

    -   For GST/HST, firms must track taxes collected and input tax credits
    -   Difficult for firms initially because they did not have appropriate systems
    -   Keeping track of exempt items is also difficult
    -   Need to make improvements to make tax more efficient

![](images/clipboard-172103778.png){fig-align="center"}

## Improvements to GST

-   Increase tax base by taxing basic groceries?

    -   Reduces compliance costs
    -   Politically difficult

-   Tax-inclusive pricing

    -   In other parts of the world, prices include all taxes
    -   In North America, prices are shown before tax
    -   Economists prefer tax to be visible, but inclusive pricing is simpler

# Provincial Sales Taxes

## Introduction

-   As noted, some provinces combine GST and PST

    -   GST is a value added tax (VAT)
    -   PST is a retail sales tax (RST)

-   RSTs are generally charged only at the point of sale to final consumer

    -   No input tax credits for businesses

-   BC, MB, SK, QC all have PST

    -   AB has no PST

## RST vs VAT

-   An RST can be equivalent to VAT when

    -   Rate is the same
    -   Tax base is the same
    -   RST is charged only on final sales

-   In bread example, RST would be charged only by grocer

    -   Grocer sells bread for \$1000, pays \$100 in RST
    -   Sum of VAT amounts is also \$100
    -   Difference is that VAT is collected in stages, RST only at final sale

## RST vs VAT

-   They can differ in other circumstances

-   Big issue with HST in BC was that it had broader tax base than PST

-   Can also sometimes lead to tax cascading

    -   If tax is charged on some inputs

## Tax Bases

-   Unlike the HST, the tax base for PST varies from province to province

-   Prepared meals

    -   Taxed in MB, SK, QC
    -   Not taxed in BC

-   Children's clothing

    -   Taxed in SK, QC
    -   Not taxed in BC, MB

-   All provinces exempt most food

-   No economic reason for exemptions; purely political

# Excise Taxes and Custom Duties

## Excise Taxes

-   Excise taxes are specific taxes levied on particular goods

-   Levied by the federal government and all provinces

-   Items listed on next slide

-   Reasons for excise taxes

    -   Raise revenue
    -   Discourage consumption of harmful goods (e.g., tobacco, alcohol)
    -   Correct for externalities (e.g., gasoline, smoking)
    -   Sin taxes

## Excise Taxes

![](images/clipboard-1693970848.jpeg)

## Custom Duties

-   Custom duties (tariffs) are taxes on imported goods

-   In the past they were an important source of revenue

    -   Not so much today
    -   Lots of trade agreements in place that limit tariffs

-   Main point of tariffs is to protect domestic industries

    -   E.g., steel, dairy, poultry
    -   Can lead to trade wars

# Personal Consumption Taxes

## Introduction

-   Today sales taxes are levied on businesses

    -   Tax is usually added on at checkout
    -   But businesses remit to the government
    -   The statutory incidence is on business

-   Another option would be to levy the tax directly on individuals

    -   Individuals would pay tax directly to government
    -   Would file a tax return for consumption

-   Some argue that it would be better

    -   Makes it easier to take personal circumstances into account

## Personal Consumption Tax

-   Under this system, people file a tax based on consumption

-   Based only on what is consumed

    -   Excludes saving (income not consumed)

-   How would this work?

-   A person's consumption is equivalent to their income minus their change in wealth

    -   To compute consumption, add income and subtract changes in wealth
    -   Equivalently, add income and subtract anything not consumed

-   Like income taxes, there can be deductions and credits

    -   E.g., charitable donations, medical expenses

## Personal Consumption Tax

![](images/clipboard-4114351305.jpeg)

## Hall-Rabushka Flax Tax

-   Hall-Rabushka proposed one (complicated) flat consumption tax

-   Works by taxing businesses and individual compensation

-   Businesses

    -   Pay tax on sales minus purchases from other businesses
    -   Also subtract payments to workers

-   Individuals

    -   Pay tax on wages and salaries minus personal savings
    -   Also subtract investment income (dividends, interest)

-   Flat tax rate applied to each tax base

## Hall-Rabushka Flax Tax

-   Equivalent to a consumption tax levied on businesses

    -   When consumption tax levied on business, it pays tax on sales minus purchases
    -   Wages are embedded in prices, so they are implicitly taxed
    -   With Hall-Rabushka, wages are instead taxed directly at individual level

-   Only difference is point of collection of certain taxes

-   There is no system currently in place that does this

## Administration Issues

-   Not feasible if people had to add up all expenditures

-   But can work if we impute consumption by income minus saving

    -   Would require tracking of savings
    -   Can be done by bank accounts
    -   Potentially problematic for people who save outside of banks

## Administration Issues

-   Some types of consumption are hard to tax

    -   Consumption benefits generated by things like housing
    -   E.g., owner-occupied housing

-   How would we tax this?

-   One option: tax prepayment

    -   Tax the house (or car, or other durable) at the point of purchase
    -   The value of the durable today is the present value of future consumption services (imputed rent)
    -   The tax charged now should equal to the taxes charged on consumption benefits

## Benefits of Personal Consumption Tax

-   Avoid issues of capital gains and depreciation

    -   Only consumption is taxed
    -   So no need to track capital gains

-   Less investment lock-in

    -   With income tax, investors may hold onto assets to avoid capital gains tax
    -   With consumption tax, can sell and reinvest without tax consequences

-   Removes need for separate personal and corporate tax

# Summary

## Summary

-   Consumption taxes are an important source of government revenue

-   Value added taxes (e.g., GST, HST) are the most common form of consumption tax globally

-   Retail sales taxes are simpler but can lead to tax cascading

-   Excise taxes and custom duties are other forms of consumption taxes

-   Consumption taxes are often more efficient than income taxes

-   Personal consumption taxes are an alternative way to tax consumption directly
