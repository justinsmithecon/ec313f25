# Goals of This Section

## Goals of This Section

-   Define and discuss types of consumption taxes

-   Analyze the efficiency and equity implications of consumption taxes

-   Introduce and discuss value added taxes and retail sales taxes

-   Summarize Canada's consumption taxation

-   Compare consumption taxes to income taxes

# Overview

## Introduction

-   As we know, purchases of final goods are taxed

-   These taxes are called **consumption taxes**

-   There are several types charged depending on province of residence and the type of good or service purchased

    -   They have features that distinguish them from each other

-   In this section we outline the different types of taxes and discuss their merits

## Types of Consumption Taxes

-   Value Added Tax (VAT)

    -   Charged at each stage of production based on the value added at that stage
    -   Used globally for taxation of consumption

-   Retail Sales Tax (RST)

    -   Charged only at the point of sale to the final consumer
    -   Used in some provinces in Canada

-   Excise Taxes

    -   Charged on specific goods, often to discourage consumption (e.g., tobacco, alcohol)
    -   Used in all provinces in Canada and by federal government

-   Custom Duties (tariffs)

    -   Charged on goods imported into the country
    -   Used by federal government only

## Revenue from Consumption Taxes

# Reasons for Consumption Taxes

## Administrative Ease

-   Relative to other taxes, consumption taxes are easy to administer

-   Import duties are collected at the time of importation

    -   In the past, relatively few items were imported
    -   Much more now, but still straightforward to collect

-   Sales taxes are collected from retailers

    -   Lots of retailers to collect from, but less than for income tax

    -   Some complications can arise for taxable and non-taxable goods

        -   Example: Less than 6 baked goods at a time are taxable, but 6 or more is non-taxable
        -   Some basic groceries are zero rated

## Efficiency

-   Economists argue that consumption taxes are more efficient than income taxes

-   Because they do not distort savings behaviour

    -   Income taxes reduce the return to saving
    -   Consumption taxes do not affect the return to saving

-   Example on next slide illustrates this using two period model

    -   Assume individuals live for two periods
    -   One person earns income in period 1 and consumes it all
    -   Another person earns income in period 1, saves some, and consumes in period 2
    -   Tax rate on income is 50%, tax rate on consumption is 100%, and interest rate is 10%

## Efficiency

|  |  |  |  |  |
|-------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
|  | **Inc Tax** | **Inc Tax** | **Cons Tax** | **Cons Tax** |
| **Item** | **Homer** | **Marge** | **Homer** | **Marge** |
| **Income in period 1** | 100.00 | 100.00 | 100.00 | 100.00 |
| **Taxes in period 1** | 50.00 | 50.00 | 50.00 | 26.19 |
| **Consumption in period 1** | 50.00 | 25.61 | 50.00 | 26.19 |
| **Savings in period 1** | 0.00 | 24.39 | 0.00 | 47.62 |
| **Interest earnings in period 2** | 0.00 | 2.44 | 0.00 | 4.76 |
| **Taxes in period 2** | 0.00 | 1.22 | 0.00 | 26.19 |
| **Consumption in period 2** | 0.00 | 25.61 | 0.00 | 26.19 |
| **PDV of taxes** | 50.00 | 51.11 | 50.00 | 50.00 |


## Efficiency

- Under the income tax

  - Saving is discouraged because the return is less
  - Marge pays more in present discounted value of taxes (51.11) than Homer (50.00)
  
      - So there is a lack of horizontal equity
      - Marge and Homer are not taxed the same for the same lifetime income
      
- Under the consumption tax

  - Saving is not discouraged because the return is unaffected
  - Marge and Homer pay the same present discounted value of taxes (50.00)
  
      - So there is horizontal equity
      - Marge and Homer are taxed the same for the same lifetime income


## Efficiency

- There is still an excess burden from the consumption tax

  - Consumption tax distorts choice between consumption and leisure
  - People will substitute towards leisure, creating excess burden
  
- Studies show that the consumption tax has lower excess burden than income tax
