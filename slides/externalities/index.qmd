# Goals of This Section

## Goals of This Section

-   Define and discuss externalities

-   Differentiate between negative and positive externalities

-   Discuss private responses to externalities

-   Discuss public responses to externalities, including Pigouvian taxes and subsidies

# Externalities

## Defining Externalities

-   Absent any market failures, economic theory says private markets lead to efficient outcomes

-   Resources are allocated to their best possible uses

-   This is the first fundamental theorem of welfare economics

-   However, in some cases, private markets fail to achieve efficiency

-   One important source of market failure is externalities

    -   An **externality** is a cost or benefit imposed on a third party not involved in a market transaction

## Defining Externalities

-   Some examples of negative externalities

    -   Carbon emissions: pollution from burning fossil fuels harms the environment and public health
    -   Crypto mining: high energy consumption leads to increased greenhouse gas emissions
    -   Noise pollution: loud nightclubs disturb nearby residents
    -   Fertilizer runoff: agricultural chemicals contaminate water supplies

-   Some examples of positive externalities

    -   Vaccinations: immunized individuals reduce disease spread, benefiting others
    -   Education: educated individuals contribute to a more informed and productive society
    -   Public parks: green spaces enhance community well-being and property values
    -   Research and development: innovations can lead to widespread technological advancements

## Defining Externalities

-   Economic problem with externalities

    -   When externalities are present, private markets may not allocate resources efficiently
    -   Negative externalities can lead to overproduction of harmful goods
    -   Positive externalities can lead to underproduction of beneficial goods

-   In these instances, there are possible solutions to the inefficiency

    -   Private solutions: negotiation between affected parties (Coase theorem)
    -   Public solutions: government intervention through taxes, subsidies, or regulations

## Characteristics of Externalities

-   Can be produced by individuals, firms, or governments

    -   Usually think of firms polluting
    -   Individuals can also create externalities (e.g., loud parties, smoking in public)

-   They are reciprocal

    -   One party's actions can create externalities for another party, and vice versa
    -   Example: a factory polluting a river affects downstream residents, but protesting and restricting them affects the factory's operations

-   Can be positive or negative

    -   Negative externalities impose costs on others (e.g., pollution)
    -   Positive externalities provide benefits to others (e.g., education)

## Characteristics of Externalities

-   Sometimes hard to distintuish from public goods

    -   Public goods are goods that are non-excludable and non-rivalrous

    -   Externalities can sometimes have similar characteristics (e.g., clean air)

    -   Key difference is intention

        -   Externalities are unintended side effects of economic activities
        -   Public goods are intentionally provided for the benefit of all

    -   Example: public fireworks may are both a public good and create externalities

        -   Created intentially for everyone to enjoy
        -   But people living nearby may experience noise pollution (negative externality)

# Inefficiency of Externalities

## Negative Externalities

-   Inefficiency of externalities comes from the divergence between private and social costs/benefits

    -   Individuals involved in a market transaction only consider their private costs and benefits
    -   Typically ignore the social costs

-   With negative externalities this leads to overproduction

-   In this section we outline how that happens

## Negative Externalities

-   Consider two individuals

    -   Azul: operates factory that dumps waste into a river
    -   Jules: fisherman downstream from Azul's factory

-   Water pollution affects Jules' ability to fish

-   Nobody owns the river that is polluted

    -   This is key to the externality
    -   If someone owned the river, a price mechanism could be established to account for pollution
    -   But without ownership, it is used at a zero price

-   The water is a scarce resource that can be used up

    -   Polluting it reduces the amount of clean water available for others

## Negative Externalities

-   Consider how much output Azul chooses to produce

-   He faces private marginal cost (PMC) and private marginal benefit (PMB)

    -   The costs and benefits that apply only to him
    -   Ignores the costs imposed on others

-   Azul produces where PMB = PMC

-   Azul's production also creates damage to the river

    -   This damage imposes costs on Jules

-   Assume that the marginal damage (MD) increases with output

    -   Each additional unit of output causes more damage than the last

-   Depicted on graph as the upward sloping MD curve

-   The social cost of production includes both the private cost and the damage to others

    -   Social marginal cost (SMC) = PMC + MD

-   SMC curve lies above the PMC curve by the amount of MD

-   SMC is what costs Azul would face if they had to pay for the damage they cause

-   Assume that the private and social benefits are the same (PMB = SMB)

-   From a social point of view, optimum is where PMB = SMC
:::
::::::

## Negative Externalities

-   Ignoring the negative externality leads to overproduction

    -   Too much cost to society relative to the benefits

-   This creates and inefficiency

-   We can quantify the inefficiency using the graph

-   Figure on next slide shows the inefficiency with some hypothetical numbers

    -   Produces less and benefits less privately

-   Society gains area dhg
:::
::::::

## Negative Externalities

-   What activities tend to pollute and cause negative externalities?

    -   Manufacturing and industrial processes
    -   Transportation (cars, trucks, airplanes)
    -   Energy production (coal, oil, natural gas)
    -   Agriculture (fertilizers, pesticides, livestock)
    -   Waste disposal (landfills, incineration)
    -   Many of these produce smog, which pollutes the air and travels long distances

-   Which pollutants do harm?

    -   Particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10): tiny particles that can penetrate lungs and cause respiratory issues
    -   Nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2): contribute to acid rain and respiratory problems

## Negative Externalities

-   What is the value of the damage?

    -   Difficult to measure precisely
    -   Economists have used differences in house prices in areas with different levels of pollution
    -   Illustrates how much people are willing to pay to avoid pollution
    -   But can be complicated by other factors affecting house prices

## Positive Externalities

-   Less salient, but some production leads to positive externalities

    -   Vaccinations: reduce disease spread, benefiting others
    -   Education: educated individuals contribute to a more informed and productive society
    -   Public parks: green spaces enhance community well-being and property values
    -   Research and development: innovations can lead to widespread technological advancements

-   Can lead to similar inefficiencies

    -   This time due to underproduction

# Private Solutions to Externalities

## Introduction

-   With market failures, government can intervene to get to efficient outcome

-   But they do not have to

-   In the case of externalities, private solutions are sometimes possible

-   Issue with externalities is that property rights are not well defined

    -   Example: nobody owns the river that Azul pollutes

-   Can be solved by allocating property rights

## Coase Theorem

-   **Coase Theorem**: if property rights are well defined and transaction costs are low, private parties can negotiate to resolve externalities efficiently

    -   It does not matter who owns the property rights

-   Suppose Azul owns the river

    -   Azul has the right to pollute
    -   Would be willing to not produce an extra unit if he is paid PMB-PMC or more
    -   Jules would pay Azul to not produce if the payment is less than MD
    -   Payments could happen if PMB-PMC \> MD

## Coase Theorem

:::::: columns
:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {layout="[[-1], [1], [-1]]"}
![](images/clipboard-385464620.jpeg)
:::
::::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Suppose Azul owns the river and is currently producing the private optimum

    -   Marginal damage at that point is ef
    -   PMB-PMC for Azul is zero
    -   Jules could pay to not produce that unit

-   At every output above the social optimum MD \> PMB-PMC

    -   Jules could pay Azul to reduce output

-   At social optimum MD = PMB-PMC

    -   No further mutually beneficial trades possible
:::
::::::

## Coase Theorem

-   Bargaining also works if Jules owns the river

    -   Azul would pay Jules to allow pollution

-   Azul would pay up to PMB-PMC to pollute

-   Jules takes that payment if it is more than MD

-   Bargaining stops where PMB-PMC = MD

## Coase Theorem

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {layout="[[-1], [1], [-1]]"}
![](images/clipboard-385464620.jpeg)
:::
::::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Consider starting at zero and moving up

-   Will Azul produce the next unit?

-   At low levels of output, PMB-PMC is large, and MD is small

    -   Worth it for Azul to produce and pay for damage

-   As more units are produced, PMB-PMC falls and MD rises

-   They are equal when production reaches social optimum
:::
::::::

## Coase Theorem

-   Coase won a Nobel prize for this insight into externalities

-   However, there are limitations

    -   Transaction costs may be high
    -   Many parties may be involved
    -   Property rights may be hard to define or enforce

-   Air pollution is good example of these problems

    -   Many polluters and many affected parties
    -   Hard to assign property rights to air

## Mergers

-   The Coase Theorem is an example of internalizing an externality

    -   Making it part of the costs or benefits of the decision maker

-   Another way to internalize an externality is through mergers

    -   If Azul and Jules merge into one firm, the externality disappears
    -   The new firm considers both private costs and damages

## Social Conventions

-   Sometimes social conventions can help solve externalities

    -   People may voluntarily reduce negative externalities to avoid social disapproval
    -   Example: littering, smoking in public

-   However, social conventions may not be sufficient for large-scale externalities

    -   Example: climate change requires coordinated action beyond social norms

# Public Solutions to Externalities

## Introduction

-   This is a class in public economics, so it is natural to consider government intervention

-   Government can use taxes, subsidies, or regulations to address externalities

-   This is a feasible approach when private solutions are not possible or insufficient

    -   There are many situations where private solutions fail

-   Government approaches are or have been used in practice to address carbon emissions

    -   Carbon tax
    -   Cap and trade
    -   Regulations

## Pigouvian Taxes for Negative Externalities

-   With negative externalities, too much is produced

    -   People/firms do not consider the full social cost of their actions

-   One way to internalize the externality is through a **Pigouvian tax**

    -   A tax equal to the marginal damage at the socially optimal level of output

-   As with other taxes, this imposes a cost on the producer

    -   Changes their incentives to account for the externality

## Pigouvian Taxes for Negative Externalities

![](images/ros55466_0504.jpg){fig-align="center"}
:::
::::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   The socially optimal output is where PMB = SMC

-   But private producers only consider PMC

-   Pigouvian tax shifts PMC up to intersect PMB at the social optimum

    -   Private producers now face the full social cost of production

-   The tax equals the vertical distance between PMC and SMC at the social optimum

-   Revenues equal height of the tax times quantity produced
:::
::::::

## Pigouvian Taxes for Negative Externalities

-   Graph makes pigouvian tax seem straightforward

-   But depends on knowing the marginal damage function

    -   Difficult to measure in practice

-   In practice, governments may not get the tax at the perfect level

    -   But even an approximate tax can improve efficiency

## Pigouvian Subsidies for Negative Externalities

-   Pigouvian taxes are a natural way to address negative externalities

    -   Acts like a punnishment for harmful behavior

-   But the optimal output can also be achieved by *subsidizing* polluters

    -   Paying the polluter to reduce output

-   The subsidy would equal the marginal damage at the social optimum

-   Any production above the social optimum would be discouraged by the subsidy

:::
::::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Consider producing $Q_1$ initially

-   Where $PMB = PMC$

-   Government offers subsidy equal to MD at social optimum for each unit not produced

    -   This **increases** the private marginal cost
    -   Cost = PMC + foregone subsidy
    -   Shifts the cost curve up

-   Acts the same way as the tax

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   It is now optimal to produce at the social optimum

-   The government must pay money for each unit not produced

    -   Equals the height of the subsidy times the reduction in quantity from $Q_1$ to $Q^*$
:::
::::::

## Pigouvian Subsidies for Negative Externalities

-   Pigouvian subsidies for negative externalities are problematic

    -   Politically difficult to justify paying polluters

    -   Requires government to have funds to pay subsidies

        -   Could require taxes elsewhere

    -   Would increase firm profits and draw firms into the industry

-   There are some real world examples

    -   EV rebates
    -   Subsidies for renewable energy production

## Emissions Fees for Negative Externalities

-   A subtle detail about the pigouvian tax is that it is levied on *output*

    -   Tax gives the incentive to reduce output
    -   But does not directly target emissions
    -   Could be that the firm installs a pollution control technology instead of reducing output
    -   In the case of the pigouvian tax, the tax bill would be the same

-   An alternative is an *emissions fee*

    -   A tax on the amount of pollution emitted
    -   Directly targets the externality
    -   Still provides the incentive to reduce emissions through any means

-   Graph depicts costs on vertical axis, emissions on horizontal

-   Marginal damage (MD) increases with emissions

    -   There is a benefit to reducing emissions

-   Marginal abatement cost (MAC) increases with abatement

    -   Abatement reduces emissions, but is costly
    -   Read this curve from right to left
    -   i.e. at $E_0$ emissions, abatement is zero and MAC is zero

-   Without emissions fee, firm emits $E_0$

-   There are net societal benefits to reducing emissions from $E_0$ to $E^*$

    -   Reducing emissions reduces damage
    -   There are costs, but benefits exceed costs

-   Without some intervention, firm would not incur the cost of abatement despite societal benefit

-   Government can impose an emissions fee equal to MD at $E^*$

    -   This incentivizes the firm to reduce emissions to the social optimum

-   Imagine reducing emissions by one unit below $E_0$

    -   Firm incurs cost of MAC
    -   But avoids paying the emissions fee equal to f
    -   Emissions fee is higher, so worth doing

-   Firm continues reducing emissions until MAC = f

    -   This occurs at $E^*$, the social optimum
    -   Beyond that point, MAC exceeds f, so not worth further abatement
:::
::::::

## Emissions Fees for Negative Externalities

-   What if there are multiple polluters?

    -   Each firm has different abatement costs
    -   Each firm has different levels of pollution
    -   But fee is the same for each polluter

-   Mechanism works the same way

    -   Each firm reduces emissions until MAC = f
    -   Firms with low abatement costs reduce more
    -   Firms with high abatement costs reduce less

## Emissions Fees for Negative Externalities

![](images/ros55466_0507.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Emissions Fees for Negative Externalities

-   Canada's carbon tax was an example of an emissions fee

    -   Applied to fossil fuels based on their carbon content
    -   Incentivized firms and individuals to reduce carbon emissions

-   Additional detail is that it was revenue-neutral

    -   Most revenues were distributed back to individuals as lump sum payments

-   This has been paused as of 2025 in favour of other approaches

    -   Likely some regulations or subsidies

## Tradeable Permits for Negative Externalities

-   Another approach to addressing negative externalities is through tradeable permits (cap-and-trade)

    -   Government sets a cap on total emissions allowed
    -   Issues permits equal to the cap
    -   Firms can buy and sell permits in a market

-   Government can either give away the permits or auction them

    -   In the real world, they are typically auctioned

## Tradeable Permits for Negative Externalities

-   Imagine government wants to cap emissions at 135 units

    -   Issues 135 permits
    -   Each permit allows one unit of emissions

-   Azul is allocated 90 units, Madrid 45 units

-   This initial allocation does not matter

-   In graph on next slide, initially Azul emits 90 units, Madrid 45 units

-   There is an incentive for Azul to sell some of its permits to Madrid

    -   Madrid willing to pay more than Azul's cost to reduce emissions
    -   Keep trading until MACs are equalized

## Tradeable Permits for Negative Externalities

![](images/ros55466_0508.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Tradeable Permits for Negative Externalities

- Cap and trade achieves the social optimum

    -   Total emissions equal to the cap
    -   Firms reduce emissions until MACs are equalized
    
- Note that the emissions reduction is achieved regardless of permit trading

  - The trades just ensure that reductions are made by firms with the lowest costs

- Quebec has a cap and trade system in place

    - Linked with California's system
    - Covers large industrial emitters and fuel distributors
    
## Regulations and Negative Externalities

- Market approaches like taxes and cap-and-trade allow the firms to figure out how to reduce emissions

    - Provide flexibility and cost-effectiveness
    
- The government can just regulate emissions directly

    - Set limits on emissions for firms
    - Require use of specific technologies
    
- Generally, regulations are less efficient

    - Do not allow firms to find the cheapest way to reduce emissions
    - Can be more costly overall
    
    
## Subsidies for Positive Externalities

- Negative externalities are more prominent in policy discussions

- But positive externalities also create inefficiencies

    -   Too little of the good is produced
    
- Key areas with positive externalities

    -   Education
    -   Vaccinations
    -   Research and development
    
- Governments often subsidize these activities to encourage more production

## Subsidies for Positive Externalities

- Pigouvian subsidies can address positive externalities

    -   Subsidy equal to the external marginal benefit at the social optimum
    -   This increases private marginal benefit to equal social marginal benefit
    -   Encourages more production to the socially optimal level

- Main issue with subsidies is that they need to be funded

    -   Requires government revenue from taxes or other sources
    -   Can create political challenges
    
    
## Regulations for Positive Externalities

- We can regulate to encourage more production of goods with positive externalities

    -   Mandatory schooling laws
    -   Vaccination requirements for school entry
    

- Typically failure to comply results in penalties

    -   Fines
    -   Denial of services (e.g., school enrollment)
    
- Main issue is balancing freedom versus public good

    -   Can be controversial in some cases
    - Vaccines are especially contentious in recent years
    
# Implications for the Income Distribution

## Introduction

- All of the discussion has been about efficiency

  - How to get to the socially optimal level of production
  
- But equity is also important

  - How are the costs and benefits of externalities distributed across society?
  - How are the costs and benefits of government interventions distributed?
  
  
## Who Benefits?


- The costs and benefits of externalities are not evenly distributed

  - Low income neighbourhoods bear costs of pollution disproportionately
  
      -   Pollution from factories often located near low-income neighborhoods
      -   Health impacts from pollution can exacerbate existing inequalities
        
  - They also stand to benefit more from vaccination policies
  
      -   Lower-income individuals may have less access to healthcare
      - May also live in denser areas, increasing disease spread risk
      -   Vaccination reduces disease spread in vulnerable populations


- Policies to address externalities should consider these distributional impacts

## Who Bears Costs?

- As with taxes, it is not always clear who bears costs

- With a Pigouvian tax, emissions fee, or regulation, it is not as simple as who pays the tax

    -   Firms may pass on costs to consumers through higher prices
    -   Workers may face lower wages if firms reduce profits
    -   Landowners may see changes in property values due to pollution or improvements
    - Subdidies are financed by taxpayers
    
- Carbon taxes on their own are regressive

    -   Low-income households spend a larger share of income on energy
    -   But rebates can offset this effect

- It is a difficult empirical question to determine the incidence of these policies

# Summary

## Summary

-   Externalities are costs or benefits imposed on third parties not involved in a market transaction
-   Negative externalities lead to overproduction, positive externalities lead to underproduction
-   Private solutions like the Coase theorem can sometimes resolve externalities
-   Public solutions include Pigouvian taxes and subsidies, emissions fees, tradeable permits, and regulations
