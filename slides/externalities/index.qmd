# Goals of This Section

## Goals of This Section

-   Define and discuss externalities

-   Differentiate between negative and positive externalities

-   Discuss private responses to externalities

-   Discuss public responses to externalities, including Pigouvian taxes and subsidies

# Externalities

## Defining Externalities

-   Absent any market failures, economic theory says private markets lead to efficient outcomes

-   Resources are allocated to their best possible uses

-   This is the first fundamental theorem of welfare economics

-   However, in some cases, private markets fail to achieve efficiency

-   One important source of market failure is externalities

    -   An **externality** is a cost or benefit imposed on a third party not involved in a market transaction

## Defining Externalities

-   Some examples of negative externalities

    -   Carbon emissions: pollution from burning fossil fuels harms the environment and public health
    -   Crypto mining: high energy consumption leads to increased greenhouse gas emissions
    -   Noise pollution: loud nightclubs disturb nearby residents
    -   Fertilizer runoff: agricultural chemicals contaminate water supplies

-   Some examples of positive externalities

    -   Vaccinations: immunized individuals reduce disease spread, benefiting others
    -   Education: educated individuals contribute to a more informed and productive society
    -   Public parks: green spaces enhance community well-being and property values
    -   Research and development: innovations can lead to widespread technological advancements

## Defining Externalities

-   Economic problem with externalities

    -   When externalities are present, private markets may not allocate resources efficiently
    -   Negative externalities can lead to overproduction of harmful goods
    -   Positive externalities can lead to underproduction of beneficial goods

-   In these instances, there are possible solutions to the inefficiency

    -   Private solutions: negotiation between affected parties (Coase theorem)
    -   Public solutions: government intervention through taxes, subsidies, or regulations

## Characteristics of Externalities

-   Can be produced by individuals, firms, or governments

    -   Usually think of firms polluting
    -   Individuals can also create externalities (e.g., loud parties, smoking in public)

-   They are reciprocal

    -   One party's actions can create externalities for another party, and vice versa
    -   Example: a factory polluting a river affects downstream residents, but protesting and restricting them affects the factory's operations

-   Can be positive or negative

    -   Negative externalities impose costs on others (e.g., pollution)
    -   Positive externalities provide benefits to others (e.g., education)

## Characteristics of Externalities

-   Sometimes hard to distintuish from public goods

    -   Public goods are goods that are non-excludable and non-rivalrous

    -   Externalities can sometimes have similar characteristics (e.g., clean air)

    -   Key difference is intention

        -   Externalities are unintended side effects of economic activities
        -   Public goods are intentionally provided for the benefit of all

    -   Example: public fireworks may are both a public good and create externalities

        -   Created intentially for everyone to enjoy
        -   But people living nearby may experience noise pollution (negative externality)

# Inefficiency of Externalities

## Negative Externalities

-   Inefficiency of externalities comes from the divergence between private and social costs/benefits

    -   Individuals involved in a market transaction only consider their private costs and benefits
    -   Typically ignore the social costs

-   With negative externalities this leads to overproduction

-   In this section we outline how that happens

## Negative Externalities

-   Consider two individuals

    -   Azul: operates factory that dumps waste into a river
    -   Jules: fisherman downstream from Azul's factory

-   Water pollution affects Jules' ability to fish

-   Nobody owns the river that is polluted

    -   This is key to the externality
    -   If someone owned the river, a price mechanism could be established to account for pollution
    -   But without ownership, it is used at a zero price

-   The water is a scarce resource that can be used up

    -   Polluting it reduces the amount of clean water available for others

## Negative Externalities

-   Consider how much output Azul chooses to produce

-   He faces private marginal cost (PMC) and private marginal benefit (PMB)

    -   The costs and benefits that apply only to him
    -   Ignores the costs imposed on others

-   Azul produces where PMB = PMC

-   Azul's production also creates damage to the river

    -   This damage imposes costs on Jules

-   Assume that the marginal damage (MD) increases with output

    -   Each additional unit of output causes more damage than the last

-   Depicted on graph as the upward sloping MD curve

-   The social cost of production includes both the private cost and the damage to others

    -   Social marginal cost (SMC) = PMC + MD

-   SMC curve lies above the PMC curve by the amount of MD

-   SMC is what costs Azul would face if they had to pay for the damage they cause

-   Assume that the private and social benefits are the same (PMB = SMB)

-   From a social point of view, optimum is where PMB = SMC
:::

## Negative Externalities

-   Ignoring the negative externality leads to overproduction

    -   Too much cost to society relative to the benefits

-   This creates and inefficiency

-   We can quantify the inefficiency using the graph

-   Figure on next slide shows the inefficiency with some hypothetical numbers

-   Suppose we produce where PMB = PMC

-   Total benefit to Azul from production is area under PMB curve

-   What happens if we reduce output to the social optimum?

-   There is a gain for Jules, but a loss for Azul

-   Jules gains area cdhg

    -   Reduction in production means less harm to him

-   Azul loses area dcg

    -   Produces less and benefits less privately

-   Society gains area dhg
:::

## Negative Externalities

-   What activities tend to pollute and cause negative externalities?

    -   Manufacturing and industrial processes
    -   Transportation (cars, trucks, airplanes)
    -   Energy production (coal, oil, natural gas)
    -   Agriculture (fertilizers, pesticides, livestock)
    -   Waste disposal (landfills, incineration)
    -   Many of these produce smog, which pollutes the air and travels long distances

-   Which pollutants do harm?

    -   Particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10): tiny particles that can penetrate lungs and cause respiratory issues
    -   Nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2): contribute to acid rain and respiratory problems


## Negative Externalities

-   What is the value of the damage?

    -   Difficult to measure precisely
    -   Economists have used differences in house prices in areas with different levels of pollution
    -   Illustrates how much people are willing to pay to avoid pollution
    -   But can be complicated by other factors affecting house prices

## Positive Externalities

-   Less salient, but some production leads to positive externalities

    -   Vaccinations: reduce disease spread, benefiting others
    -   Education: educated individuals contribute to a more informed and productive society
    -   Public parks: green spaces enhance community well-being and property values
    -   Research and development: innovations can lead to widespread technological advancements

-   Can lead to similar inefficiencies

    -   This time due to underproduction

## Positive Externalities

-   Private and social costs are assumed equal

-   Private and social benefits differ by an external marginal benefit

    -   SMB = PMB + EMB

-   Optimum ignoring externalities is where PMB = PMC

- Social optimum is where SMB = PMC

  - At higher level of output

-   Can illustrate inefficiency using areas on the graph

- The unrealized benefit to society from underproduction is area under EMB

  - Equivalently, area between PMB and SMB curves bcda
  
- If we move to the social optimum

  - Society gains area bcda
  - Individual loses acd through extra production
  
- Total gain is area abc

# Private Solutions to Externalities

## Introduction

- With market failures, government can intervene to get to efficient outcome

- But they do not have to

- In the case of externalities, private solutions are sometimes possible

- Issue with externalities is that property rights are not well defined

  - Example: nobody owns the river that Azul pollutes
  
- Can be solved by allocating property rights


## Coase Theorem


- **Coase Theorem**: if property rights are well defined and transaction costs are low, private parties can negotiate to resolve externalities efficiently

  - It does not matter who owns the property rights
  
- Suppose Azul owns the river

  - Azul has the right to pollute
  - Would be willing to not produce an extra unit if he is paid PMB-PMC or more
  - Jules would pay Azul to not produce if the payment is less than MD
  - Payments could happen if PMB-PMC > MD

-   Suppose Azul owns the river and is currently producing the private optimum

    - Marginal damage at that point is ef
    - PMB-PMC for Azul is zero
    - Jules could pay to not produce that unit
    
- At every output above the social optimum MD > PMB-PMC

  - Jules could pay Azul to reduce output
  
- At social optimum MD = PMB-PMC

  - No further mutually beneficial trades possible

:::
::::::

## Coase Theorem

- Bargaining also works if Jules owns the river

  - Azul would pay Jules to allow pollution
  
- Azul would pay up to PMB-PMC to pollute

- Jules takes that payment if it is more than MD

- Bargaining stops where PMB-PMC = MD

-   Consider starting at zero and moving up

- Will Azul produce the next unit?

- At low levels of output, PMB-PMC is large, and MD is small

  - Worth it for Azul to produce and pay for damage
  
- As more units are produced, PMB-PMC falls and MD rises

- They are equal when production reaches social optimum
:::
::::::


## Coase Theorem

- Coase won a Nobel prize for this insight into externalities

- However, there are limitations

  - Transaction costs may be high
  - Many parties may be involved
  - Property rights may be hard to define or enforce
  
- Air pollution is good example of these problems

  - Many polluters and many affected parties
  - Hard to assign property rights to air
  
  
## Mergers

- The Coase Theorem is an example of internalizing an externality

  - Making it part of the costs or benefits of the decision maker
  
- Another way to internalize an externality is through mergers

  - If Azul and Jules merge into one firm, the externality disappears
  - The new firm considers both private costs and damages
  
## Social Conventions

- Sometimes social conventions can help solve externalities

  - People may voluntarily reduce negative externalities to avoid social disapproval
  - Example: littering, smoking in public
  
- However, social conventions may not be sufficient for large-scale externalities

  - Example: climate change requires coordinated action beyond social norms
