# Optimal Taxation

## Introduction

-   As we have discussed, government raise taxes mainly to raise revenue

-   But taxes involve costs

    -   The direct cost of the revenue raised
    -   Additional costs from distortions in behaviour (excess burden)

-   Given that revenue needs to be raised, how should taxes be designed to minimize costs?

-   Optimal taxation addresses this question

## Model

-   Question of optimal taxation is answered with a model

-   A representative citizen consumes two goods, $X$ and $Y$

    -   Prices of these goods are $P_{X}$ and $P_{Y}$

-   Person can also work and earn wage $w$

    -   Person has $T$ hours available for work ($h$) or leisure ($L$)
    -   These are the only two uses of time, so $T = h + L$

-   Their budget constraint in this context is

$$ w(T - L) = P_{X}X + P_{Y}Y$$

-   Constraint says that income is split between spending on goods $X$ and $Y$

## Model

-   If you rearrange the budget constraint, you can write it as

$$wT = P_{X}X + P_{Y}Y + wL$$

-   Shows that "full income" is split between spending on goods $X$ and $Y$ and spending on leisure

    -   Full income is $wT$ because if all time was worked, income would be $wT$
    -   Price of leisure is $w$ because each hour of leisure foregoes $w$ in earnings

-   Suppose we tax goods $X$, $Y$, and $L$ at rate $t$

-   Then the budget constraint becomes

$$ wT = (1 + t)P_{X}X + (1 + t)P_{Y}Y + (1 + t)wL$$

## Model

-   Rearranging gives

$$wT = (1+t)(P_{X}X + P_{Y}Y + wL)$$

$$ \frac{wT}{1 + t} = P_{X}X + P_{Y}Y + wL$$

-   In this setup, a tax on all goods and leisure is equivalent to a reduction in full income by a factor of $\frac{1}{1 + t}$

    -   We saw this in one of the practice questions

## Model

-   If we could tax all goods and leisure at the same rate, we would not distort behaviour

    -   People would still choose the same combination of goods and leisure

-   Why?

    -   Because relative prices are unchanged
    -   The commodity taxes are equivalent to a lump-sum tax that reduces income

-   But in practice, we cannot tax all goods and leisure at the same rate

    -   We cannot tax leisure directly
    -   Can only tax $X$ and $Y$ in this setup

-   Taxing some goods ($X$ and $Y$) but not others ($L$) distorts relative prices and leads to excess burden

## Ramsey Rule

-   Question then becomes: If we cannot tax all goods at the same rate, how should we tax them?

-   One option is **neutral taxation**: taxing $X$ and $Y$ at the same rate

    -   This is simple and easy to administer
    -   But it still distorts behaviour and creates excess burden

-   The optimal method is the **Ramsey Rule**: tax goods so that the percent reduction in quantity demanded is the same for all goods

    -   Equivalently, tax goods so that the marginal excess burden of the last dollar of revenue raised is the same for all goods

-   The next few slides establish this result

## Ramsey Rule

-   Consider again two goods, $X$ and $Y$, with prices $P_{X}$ and $P_{Y}$

-   Pretend that goods are neither substitutes nor complements

    -   Simplifies the analysis because changes in their prices do not affect each other's demand
    -   Results still hold for substitutes and complements, but analysis is more complex

-   Also pretend the supply curve is horizontal

    -   Consumers face the entire economic incidence of the tax
    -   Again simplifies the analysis because we do not have to consider supply side effects

-   Consider a unit tax $u_{X}$ on good $X$

## Ramsey Rule

-   Consumer initially consumes $X_{0}$ at price $P_{0}$

-   After tax $u_{X}$ is imposed, price rises to $P_{0} + u_{X}$

-   Consumer reduces consumption to $X_{1}$

-   As we have learned this involves an excess burden

    -   Equals area of yellow triangle
    -   Represents the loss in consumer surplus

-   Now imagine raising the tax further from $u_{X}$ to $u_{X} + 1$

-   The additional excess burden created is the **marginal excess burden**

    -   Equals area of purple triangle

-   Part of that excess burden was tax revenue (purple rectangle)

-   Other part is additional loss in consumer surplus (purple triangle)
:::
::::::

## Ramsey Rule

-   The marginal excess burden of the tax on good $X$ is the purple area

    -   Equals area of the purple triangle plus the purple rectangle

-   To compute that mathematically, set $\Delta x = X_{1} - X_{2}$

-   The total area is then

$$ (\frac{1}{2} \Delta x \times 1) + (\Delta x u_{X})  $$

-   As noted in the textbook, if we pretend that $\frac{1}{2} \Delta x$ is very small, we can ignore it

    -   So marginal excess burden is approximately $\Delta x u_{X}$

## Ramsey Rule

-   Going one step further, note that the slope of the demand curve is $$ \frac{u_{X}}{\Delta X} = \frac{1}{\Delta x} $$
    -   $\Delta X = X_{0} - X_{1}$, the initial change in quantity demanded from the initial tax
    -   Both represent the rise over the run
-   Rearranging gives

$$ \Delta x u_{X} = \Delta X$$

-   The marginal excess burden of the tax on good $X$ is approximately $\Delta X$

    -   The change in quantity demanded from the initial tax

## Ramsey Rule

-   What about the change in revenue?

-   Initially revenue was larger green rectangle plus purple rectangle

-   After, it is larger green rectangle plus smaller green rectangle

-   The marginal tax revenue is therefore the smaller green rectangle minus the purple rectangle

$$ (X_{2} \times 1) - (\Delta x u_{X}) $$

-   We previously saw that $\Delta x u_{X} = \Delta X$

-   We also know that $X_{2} = X_{1} - \Delta x$

-   Subbing in gives us

$$ X_{1} - \Delta x - \Delta X  $$

## Ramsey Rule

-   IF we pretend that $\Delta x$ is very small, we can ignore it

    -   So marginal tax revenue is approximately $X_{1} - \Delta X$

-   The marginal excess burden *per dollar of additional revenue* is

$$ \frac{\Delta X}{X_{1} - \Delta X} $$

-   If we repeat this exact exercise for good $Y$, we find that the marginal excess burden per dollar of additional revenue is

$$ \frac{\Delta Y}{Y_{1} - \Delta Y} $$

## Ramsey Rule

-   If we set them equal

$$ \frac{\Delta X}{X_{1} - \Delta X} = \frac{\Delta Y}{Y_{1} - \Delta Y} $$

-   Which simplifies to the **Ramsey Rule**

$$ \frac{\Delta X}{X_{1}} = \frac{\Delta Y}{Y_{1}} $$

-   If you multiply both sides by $100$ to express this as a percentage, it says percent change in quantity demanded of $X$ equals percent change in quantity demanded of $Y$

## Ramsey Rule with Elasticities

-   Economists enjoy expressing things in terms of elasticities

-   The price elasticity of demand is

$$ \eta_{X} = \frac{\Delta X}{\Delta P_{X}} \times \frac{P_{X}}{X} $$

-   Rearrange that to get

$$ \frac{\Delta X}{X} = \eta_{X} \times \frac{\Delta P_{X}}{P_{X}} $$

## Ramsey Rule with Elasticities

-   In this case, consider instead an ad valorem tax that makes the price rise to $P_{X}(1 + t_{X})$

-   The numerator of this fraction is then $\Delta P_{X} = P_{X}(1+t_{X}) -  P_{X} = P_{X}t_{X}$

-   Substituting into the equation on the previous slide gives

$$\frac{\Delta X}{X}  =  \eta_{X} \times t_{X}  $$

## Ramsey Rule with Elasticities

-   the Ramsay Rule then becomes

$$ \eta_{X} t_{X} = \eta_{Y} t_{Y} $$

-   Equivalently

$$ \frac{t_{X}}{t_{Y}} = \frac{\eta_{Y}}{\eta_{X}} $$

## Ramsey Rule with Elasticities

-   The **inverse elasticity rule** says that the optimal tax rate on a good is inversely proportional to its price elasticity of demand

    -   If good $Y$ has a high elasticity relative to good $X$, then $t_{X}$ should be higher than $t_{Y}$

-   Why?

    -   Because a tax on a good with a high elasticity will cause a large reduction in quantity demanded
    -   This creates a large excess burden
    -   So to minimize excess burden, tax goods with high elasticities less

## Corlett-Hague Rule

-   Recall that we could not tax leisure directly

    -   And therefore could not apply an efficient (lump-sum equivalent) tax
    -   This created the excess burden

-   Corlett-Hague suggest approximating a leisure tax by taxing goods that are complements (used together with) to leisure

    -   Examples: tax sporting equipment, household appliances, recreational vehicles, etc.

-   This indirectly lowers demand for leisure and acts like a tax on leisure

-   Gets us a bit closer to the most efficient outcome

## Equity in Taxation

-   Ramsey rule implies taxing goods that are inelastic more heavily

-   Makes sense when those goods are socially undesirable (e.g., cigarettes, alcohol)

-   But what if those goods are necessities (e.g., food, clothing, housing, medicine)?

-   Problematic for a few reasons, but one is that it lacks **vertical equity**

    -   Vertical equity: people with greater ability to pay should pay more in taxes

-   You can modify the Ramsey rule to account for vertical equity

    -   A modified rule may tax necessities less heavily
    -   Essentially allows for larger excess burden to achieve greater equity

## Summary

-   In the real world we cannot achieve the efficient outcome of a lump-sum tax to raise government revenue

-   Distortionary taxes change behaviour and create an excess burden

-   We can design the tax system to minimize the excess burden

-   The Ramsey rule gives that optimal design

-   But tax efficiency is not the sole consideration

    -   Equity is also important
    -   The optimal rule can change to account for equity considerations

# Optimal User Fees

## Introduction

-   Governments often charge user fees for public services

    -   **User fee**: a fee charged by the government for the use of a good or service
    -   Examples: park entrance fees, toll roads, public transit fares, etc.

-   Like a tax, but not a tax

-   Determining the optimal user fee is similar to determining the optimal tax

-   Governments sometimes produce goods/services when there is a natural monopoly

    -   **Natural Monopoly**: a market where a single firm can produce the entire output at lower cost than multiple firms
    -   Happens with continuously decreasing average costs
    -   Examples: water, electricity, public transit, etc.

-   Natural monopoly depicted to the left

-   Marginal cost fixed for ease of analysis

    -   Could also draw it downward sloping as in the text

-   An unregulated monopolist would produce $Q_{0}$ where MR = MC

-   Would charge price $P_{0}$

-   The monopoly earns excess profits equal to yellow area

-   Also associated with deadweight loss (excess burden) equal to red area

-   The monopolist does not produce the efficient (P=MC) level of Z

-   The government could take over and produce the good/service

    -   Or regulate the private monopolist

-   There are different options for production

-   One is to produce the efficient level $Q_{1}$ where $P = MC$

-   But price $P_{1}$ is below average cost $AC$

-   The government would incur a loss equal to green area

-   Another option is average cost pricing

-   Produce $Q_{2}$ where $P = AC$

-   Government incurs no excess profits or losses

-   Price $P_{2}$ is above $MC$, so there is still some deadweight loss (excess burden) equal to red area
:::
::::::

## Government Production

-   A third option is to set P=MC and charge a lump sum tax to cover the loss

    -   Hard to do in practice because generally cannot levy lump sum taxes
    -   Consumers not using the good would pay for it

-   A fourth option is a two-part tariff

    -   Set P=MC and charge a fixed fee to cover the loss
    -   Only users of the good pay the fee
    -   Divide the fee by the number of users to get the fee per user

## Government Production

-   Lastly, use the Ramsey Rule

    -   If government produces muliple goods/services, set user fees for each
    -   Optimally set them so that the percent reduction in quantity demanded is the same for all goods/services
    -   We saw that this involves setting higher fees goods/services with inelastic demand
    -   The user fee effectively acts like a tax on the good/service

# Optimal Income Tax

## Introduction

-   So far we have discussed optimal commodity taxes and user fees

-   Income taxes are another major source of government revenue

-   Income taxes are different because they tax a person's ability to pay

    -   Ability to pay is determined by income
    -   Income taxes therefore affect both labour supply and consumption

-   You can design an income tax optimally

## Old School Optimal Tax

-   A very old approach to optimal income taxation is **Edgeworth's Model**

-   A model based on the following assumptions

    -   Maximize **social welfare**: the combination of individual utilities
    -   In this model, the social welfare is **utilitarian**: the sum of individual utilities
    -   Each person's utility is the same, depends only on income
    -   Has diminishing marginal utility of income
    -   Total amount of income in society is fixed

-   This model predicts that after-tax income is the same for everyone

    -   Involves taxing rich and giving to poor until equality is reached

-   This is not a realistic model, but it is a starting point

## Newer Approach to Optimal Tax

-   Major problem with Edgeworth's model is that it ignores behavioural responses

    -   People will supply less labour if taxed heavily

-   We know from previous sections that taxes affect labour supply

-   Modern models take this into account

    -   Taxes raise revenue
    -   But also create excess burden by distorting labour supply
    -   Optimal tax balances these two effects

-   These models compute optimal tax in a world where people choose labour and leisure

-   A simplified version of this model is depicted to the left

-   In this setup revenue is

$$ Revenue = -\alpha + t \times Income $$

-   The term $-\alpha$ is a fixed payment to everyone

    -   If $\alpha > 0$, it is a subsidy
    -   If $\alpha < 0$, it is a lump-sum tax

-   The term $t$ is the marginal income tax\

-   A constant marginal tax is a **flat tax**

    -   Comes from a linear tax schedule

-   Studies find that the optimal income tax is non-linear

    -   Marginal tax rate rises with income
    -   Implies a progressive tax system
    -   This exists in many countries, including Canada and the US

-   However, they also find that the optimal non-linear tax is approximated a flat tax

    -   So we can still gain insights from the flat tax

-   Now plot the proportion of income paid in tax

-   Here you can see the progressivity of the tax

-   The tax with the highest marginal tax rate ($t=0.5$) and the lowest fixed payment ($\alpha = -3000$) is the most progressive

-   The higher the marginal tax rate, the more progressive the tax

-   The lower the fixed payment, the more progressive the tax
:::
::::::

## Newer Approach to Optimal Tax

-   The specific optimal tax rates depend on the model assumptions

    -   Labour supply elasticity
    -   Social welfare function
    -   Ability to pay
    -   Income distribution

-   With the utilitarian social welfare function, optimal is around 50%

    -   Optimal grant $\alpha$ is about 60% of average worker income

-   Using a more egalitarian social welfare function, optimal tax is higher

    -   Egalitarian social welfare function puts more weight on poorer individuals
    -   Optimal rate around 80%

-   Finally, some studies find that if tax rates are allowed to be different, rich should pay lower marginal rate

# Politics and Time Inconsistency

## Introduction

-   Optimal tax theory provides purely theoretical guidance on how to design taxes

-   In practice, tax policy is determined by politics

    -   Politicians care about getting elected
    -   Voters care about their own taxes and benefits

-   So the optimal tax is not a realistic outcome

-   It is possible that in the real world, implementing the optimal tax is not even desirable

## Time Inconsistency Problem

-   Imagine a government wants to tax society to raise revenue

-   There are three possible goods that people can consume

    -   $X$, $Y$, and Leisure $L$

-   Labour has a fixed supply so income is also fixed

-   The government is allowed to tax $X$, but not $Y$

-   A tax economist suggests lowering the tax on $X$ and taxing $X$ and $Y$ at the same rate

    -   Efficient because relative prices are unchanged, no change in labour
    -   No excess burden

## Time Inconsistency Problem

-   Citizens are cynical

    -   They think the government will implement the tax on $Y$ but not lower it on $X$
    -   View the government as trying to maximize revenue at their expense
    -   In certain situations they might be right

-   If they are correct, taxing only $X$ is more efficient than the alternative of taxing both

-   This is an example of the **time inconsistency problem**: optimal tax policy is not credible over time

    -   The government cannot commit to future policies

-   To fully implement optimal tax, the government must credibly commit to future policies

    -   This is difficult in practice
    -   So optimal tax may not be achievable or even desirable

# Other Criteria for Tax Design

## Horizontal Equity

-   **Horizontal Equity**: people in "equal positions" should be treated equally

    -   When it comes to taxation, equal positions might mean equal ability to pay, out of income, consumption, or wealth

-   Horizontal equity is desirable because it is viewed as fair

    -   People in equal positions should pay the same tax
    -   If not, people may view the tax system as unfair and try to avoid taxes

-   Defining horizontal equity in terms of income or wage is problematic

    -   Two people who earn the same wage but work different hours have different abilities to pay
    -   Taxing wage instead is a problem because it is based on human capital investments

## Horizontal Equity

-   Could instead define horizontal equity in terms of utility

    -   **Utility definition of horizontal equity**: people with the same pre-tax utility should have the same after-tax utility, and taxes should not alter the utility ordering

-   Several problems with this approach

    -   Utility is unobservable

    -   If taxing only income, it can penalize people who

        -   Consume goods that are income intensive
        -   Work in jobs where the pay is purely monetary instead of non-income benefits (e.g. nice work environment, flexible work)

    -   Depends on utility ordering prior to any new taxes being imposed (i.e. biased towards status quo)

-   Basic idea is that while horizontal equity is desirable, it is hard to define and implement in practice

## Administrative Costs

-   Taxes are costly to administer

    -   Estimates suggest direct costs of about \$1 to collect \$100 of tax revenue in Canada
    -   Average taxpayer pays about \$200-\$250 in tax preparation costs per year
    -   Adding up costs over firms, individuals, government, it costs about 2% of GDP to collect taxes in Canada

-   Tax design has to balance the benefits of a tax against its administrative costs

    -   A tax that raises a lot of revenue but is very costly to administer may not be desirable
    -   A tax that is easy to administer but raises little revenue may also not be desirable

-   Some changes in taxation have lead to smaller costs

    -   Online filing
    -   Automatic download of tax forms to online portals
    -   Potential for future: automatic filing

## Compliance

-   Canada and other countries operate on a self-assessment system

    -   Taxpayers are responsible for reporting their income and calculating their taxes
    -   Government audits a small percentage of taxpayers to ensure compliance

-   Some people engage in tax avoidance

    -   Legal ways: changing behaviour to minimize taxes
    -   Illegal ways: tax evasion, not reporting income, fraud

-   It is not always easy to catch tax evasion

    -   Government has to balance the costs of enforcement against the benefits
    -   If enforcement is too costly, it may not be worth it

-   There is an economic theory that determines "optimal" tax evasion

    -   Penalty rises with amount evaded
    -   There is some probability that you get caught

    -   Risk aversion might play a role

## Compliance

-   Also the normative question about tax evasion: do we care?

-   Some economies have large underground or informal economies

    -   Developing countries often have significant employment in informal economies

-   While it is incorrect to call them tax evaders, people in informal employment do not pay taxes

-   It might be desirable to have the underground/informal economy even if they pay no tax

    -   They are often poor and would not pay much tax
    -   They often provide goods/services that are beneficial to society
    -   Trying to eliminate the informal economy might do more harm than good

# Summary

## Summary

-   Taxes create excess burden by distorting behaviour
-   The Ramsey Rule gives the optimal way to tax goods to minimize excess burden
-   User fees can be optimized in a similar manner
-   Optimal income tax is progressive, but the specific rates depend on model assumptions
-   Politics and time inconsistency can prevent optimal tax from being implemented
-   Other criteria for tax design include horizontal equity, administrative costs, and compliance
