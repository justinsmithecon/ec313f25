# Optimal Taxation

## Introduction

-   As we have discussed, government raise taxes mainly to raise revenue

-   But taxes involve costs

    -   The direct cost of the revenue raised
    -   Additional costs from distortions in behaviour (excess burden)

-   Given that revenue needs to be raised, how should taxes be designed to minimize costs?

-   Optimal taxation addresses this question

## Model

-   Question of optimal taxation is answered with a model

-   A representative citizen consumes two goods, $X$ and $Y$

    -   Prices of these goods are $P_{X}$ and $P_{Y}$

-   Person can also work and earn wage $w$

    -   Person has $T$ hours available for work ($h$) or leisure ($L$)
    -   These are the only two uses of time, so $T = h + L$

-   Their budget constraint in this context is

$$ w(T - L) = P_{X}X + P_{Y}Y$$

-   Constraint says that income is split between spending on goods $X$ and $Y$

## Model

-   If you rearrange the budget constraint, you can write it as

$$wT = P_{X}X + P_{Y}Y + wL$$

-   Shows that "full income" is split between spending on goods $X$ and $Y$ and spending on leisure

    -   Full income is $wT$ because if all time was worked, income would be $wT$
    -   Price of leisure is $w$ because each hour of leisure foregoes $w$ in earnings

-   Suppose we tax goods $X$, $Y$, and $L$ at rate $t$

-   Then the budget constraint becomes

$$ wT = (1 + t)P_{X}X + (1 + t)P_{Y}Y + (1 + t)wL$$

## Model

-   Rearranging gives

$$wT = (1+t)(P_{X}X + P_{Y}Y + wL)$$

$$ \frac{wT}{1 + t} = P_{X}X + P_{Y}Y + wL$$

-   In this setup, a tax on all goods and leisure is equivalent to a reduction in full income by a factor of $\frac{1}{1 + t}$

    -   We saw this in one of the practice questions

## Model

-   If we could tax all goods and leisure at the same rate, we would not distort behaviour

    -   People would still choose the same combination of goods and leisure

-   Why?

    -   Because relative prices are unchanged
    -   The commodity taxes are equivalent to a lump-sum tax that reduces income

-   But in practice, we cannot tax all goods and leisure at the same rate

    -   We cannot tax leisure directly
    -   Can only tax $X$ and $Y$ in this setup

-   Taxing some goods ($X$ and $Y$) but not others ($L$) distorts relative prices and leads to excess burden

## Ramsey Rule

-   Question then becomes: If we cannot tax all goods at the same rate, how should we tax them?

-   One option is **neutral taxation**: taxing $X$ and $Y$ at the same rate

    -   This is simple and easy to administer
    -   But it still distorts behaviour and creates excess burden

-   The optimal method is the **Ramsey Rule**: tax goods so that the percent reduction in quantity demanded is the same for all goods

    -   Equivalently, tax goods so that the marginal excess burden of the last dollar of revenue raised is the same for all goods

-   The next few slides establish this result

## Ramsey Rule

-   Consider again two goods, $X$ and $Y$, with prices $P_{X}$ and $P_{Y}$

-   Pretend that goods are neither substitutes nor complements

    -   Simplifies the analysis because changes in their prices do not affect each other's demand
    -   Results still hold for substitutes and complements, but analysis is more complex

-   Also pretend the supply curve is horizontal

    -   Consumers face the entire economic incidence of the tax
    -   Again simplifies the analysis because we do not have to consider supply side effects

-   Consider a unit tax $u_{X}$ on good $X$

-   Consumer initially consumes $X_{0}$ at price $P_{0}$

-   After tax $u_{X}$ is imposed, price rises to $P_{0} + u_{X}$

-   Consumer reduces consumption to $X_{1}$

-   As we have learned this involves an excess burden

    -   Equals area of yellow triangle
    -   Represents the loss in consumer surplus

-   Now imagine raising the tax further from $u_{X}$ to $u_{X} + 1$

-   The additional excess burden created is the **marginal excess burden**

    -   Equals area of purple triangle

-   Part of that excess burden was tax revenue (purple rectangle)

-   Other part is additional loss in consumer surplus (purple triangle)
:::

## Ramsey Rule

- The marginal excess burden of the tax on good $X$ is the purple area

    - Equals area of the purple triangle plus the purple rectangle
    
- To compute that mathematically, set $\Delta x = X_{1} - X_{2}$

- The total area is then

$$ (\frac{1}{2} \Delta x \times 1) + (\Delta x u_{X})  $$

- As noted in the textbook, if we pretend that $\frac{1}{2} \Delta x$ is very small, we can ignore it

    -   So marginal excess burden is approximately $\Delta x u_{X}$


## Ramsey Rule

- Going one step further, note that the slope of the demand curve is 
$$ \frac{u_{X}}{\Delta X} = \frac{1}{\Delta x} $$  
    - $\Delta X = X_{0} - X_{1}$, the initial change in quantity demanded from the initial tax
    -   Both represent the rise over the run
    
- Rearranging gives

$$ \Delta x u_{X} = \Delta X$$

- The marginal excess burden of the tax on good $X$ is approximately $\Delta X$

    -   The change in quantity demanded from the initial tax
    

## Ramsey Rule

- What about the change in revenue?

- Initially revenue was larger green rectangle plus purple rectangle

- After, it is larger green rectangle plus smaller green rectangle

- The marginal tax revenue is therefore the smaller green rectangle minus the purple rectangle

$$ (X_{2} \times 1) - (\Delta x u_{X}) $$

- We previously saw that $\Delta x u_{X} = \Delta X$
- We also know that $X_{2} = X_{1} - \Delta x$

- Subbing in gives us

$$ X_{1} - \Delta x - \Delta X  $$

## Ramsey Rule


- IF we pretend that $\Delta x$ is very small, we can ignore it

    -   So marginal tax revenue is approximately $X_{1} - \Delta X$


- The marginal excess burden *per dollar of additional revenue* is 


$$ \frac{\Delta X}{X_{1} - \Delta X} $$

- If we repeat this exact exercise for good $Y$, we find that the marginal excess burden per dollar of additional revenue is

$$ \frac{\Delta Y}{Y_{1} - \Delta Y} $$

## Ramsey Rule

- If we set them equal

$$ \frac{\Delta X}{X_{1} - \Delta X} = \frac{\Delta Y}{Y_{1} - \Delta Y} $$

- Which simplifies to the **Ramsey Rule**

$$ \frac{\Delta X}{X_{1}} = \frac{\Delta Y}{Y_{1}} $$

- If you multiply both sides by $100$ to express this as a percentage, it says percent change in quantity demanded of $X$ equals percent change in quantity demanded of $Y$


## Ramsey Rule with Elasticities

- Economists enjoy expressing things in terms of elasticities

- The price elasticity of demand is

$$ \eta_{X} = \frac{\Delta X}{\Delta P_{X}} \times \frac{P_{X}}{X} $$

- Rearrange that to get 

$$ \frac{\Delta X}{X} = \eta_{X} \times \frac{\Delta P_{X}}{P_{X}} $$
- Substitute that into the Ramsey Rule to get


## Ramsey Rule with Elasticities


- In this case, consider instead an ad valorem tax that makes the price rise to $P_{X}(1 + t_{X})$

- The numerator of this fraction is then $\Delta P_{X} = P_{X}(1+t_{X}) -  P_{X} = P_{X}t_{X}$

- Substituting into the equation on the previous slide gives

$$\frac{\Delta X}{X}  =  \eta_{X} \times t_{X}  $$
- the Ramsay Rule then becomes

$$ \eta_{X} t_{X} = \eta_{Y} t_{Y} $$

- Equivalently

$$ \frac{t_{X}}{t_{Y}} = \frac{\eta_{Y}}{\eta_{X}} $$

## Ramsey Rule with Elasticities

- The **inverse elasticity rule** says that the optimal tax rate on a good is inversely proportional to its price elasticity of demand

    - If good $Y$ has a high elasticity relative to good $X$, then $t_{X}$ should be higher than $t_{Y}$
    
- Why?

    - Because a tax on a good with a high elasticity will cause a large reduction in quantity demanded
    -   This creates a large excess burden
    -   So to minimize excess burden, tax goods with high elasticities less
    
## Corlett-Hague Rule

- Recall that we could not tax leisure directly

    - And therefore could not apply an efficient (lump-sum equivalent) tax
    - This created the excess burden
    
- Corlett-Hague suggest approximating a leisure tax by taxing goods that are complements (used together with) to leisure

    - Examples: tax sporting equipment, household appliances, recreational vehicles, etc.

- This indirectly lowers demand for leisure and acts like a tax on leisure

- Gets us a bit closer to the most efficient outcome


## Equity in Taxation

- Ramsey rule implies taxing goods that are inelastic more heavily

- Makes sense when those goods are socially undesirable (e.g., cigarettes, alcohol)

- But what if those goods are necessities (e.g., food, clothing, housing, medicine)?

- Problematic for a few reasons, but one is that it lacks **vertical equity**

    -   Vertical equity: people with greater ability to pay should pay more in taxes
    
- You can modify the Ramsey rule to account for vertical equity

    -   A modified rule may tax necessities less heavily
    - Essentially allows for larger excess burden to achieve greater equity
    
    
## Summary

- In the real world we cannot achieve the efficient outcome of a lump-sum tax to raise government revenue

- Distortionary taxes change behaviour and create an excess burden

- We can design the tax system to minimize the excess burden

- The Ramsey rule gives that optimal design

- But tax efficiency is not the sole consideration

    - Equity is also important
    - The optimal rule can change to account for equity considerations
