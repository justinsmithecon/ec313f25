# Goals of This Section

## Goals of This Section

-   Define **Public Economics**

-   Give broad overview of Canada's government and public finance framework

-   Measure the "size" of government

-   Overview of government revenues and expenses

# What is Public Economics?

## Defining Public Economics

-   **Public Economics** is the study of the role of government in the economy

    -   It examines how government policies affect economic efficiency, income distribution, and overall welfare

-   Concerned with the *microeconomic* aspects of the economy

    -   How government actions affect individual and firm behavior
    -   Macroeconomic functions of government (fiscal policy, monetary policy) are in separate fields

-   Attempts to answer three key questions:

    -   When should the government interevene in the economy?
    -   What is the effect of these interventions?
    -   Why do they choose to intervene in this way?

## When Should the Government Intervene?

-   **Market Failures**: Situations where the free market does not allocate resources efficiently

    -   Public goods: goods that are non-excludable and non-rivalrous (e.g., national defense, public parks)

    -   Externalities: costs or benefits that affect third parties not involved in a transaction (e.g., pollution)

    -   Imperfect competition: markets dominated by a few firms, leading to monopolies or oligopolies

    -   Assymetric information: situations where one party has more or better information than the other (e.g., used car market)

    -   Irrational behaviour: situations where individuals do not make rational decisions (e.g., addiction, procrastination)

## Effects of Alternative Interventions

-   Competitive markets (in theory) generate an *efficient* allocation of resources

    -   Allocation is **Pareto Efficient**: no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off
    -   Subject to specific assumptions
    -   Called the **First Fundamental Theorem of Welfare Economics**

-   But that allocation is not always *equitable*

    -   Some people may get significantly more resources than others

## Effects of Alternative Interventions

-   Government can intervene to redistribute resources

-   In theory, it can do this without reducing efficiency

    -   Through transfers of initial wealth
    -   Called the **Second Fundamental Theorem of Welfare Economics**

-   In reality, government intervenes with taxes and transfers that may reduce efficiency

    -   Taxes can distort incentives and lead to inefficiencies
    -   Creates an efficiency-equity trade-off

## Effects of Alternative Interventions

-   **Direct Effects**: Immediate impact of government policies on individuals and firms, without changes in their behaviour

-   Examples:

    -   A carbon tax on gasoline raises revenue from drivers
    -   Income taxes raise revenue from workers
    -   Corporate taxes raise revenue from firms
    -   Tariffs raise revenue from imports
    -   A tax credit for charitable giving reduces government revenue

## Effects of Alternative Interventions

-   **Indirect (Unintended) Effects**: Effects of government policies due to changes in behaviour of individuals and firms

-   Examples:

    -   A carbon tax on gasoline may lead drivers to use public transit more
    -   Income taxes may lead workers to work fewer hours
    -   Corporate taxes may lead firms to invest less or move to a different jurisdiction
    -   Tariffs may lead consumers to buy fewer imported goods
    -   A tax credit for charitable giving may lead individuals to donate more

-   Much of current research in public economics focuses on these indirect effects

## Why Do Governments Intervene in Particular Ways?

-   **Political Economy**: a field of economics that studies the interaction between politics and economics

    -   How do politics and economics drive policy and economic outcomes?
    -   Depends on economic system, political system, norms, etc.
    -   Some example research papers:
        -   " Do Leaders Matter? National Leadership Growth Since World War II"

        -   "Why Do Developing Countries Tax So Little?"

        -   "Voting Technology, Political Responsiveness, and Infant Health: Evidence from Brazil"

-   **Public choice**: a subset of political economy that applies economic principles to political decision-making

    -   Uses a rational choice framework (e.g. utility maximization) to study political decisions

    -   Studies very similar topics to political economy as a whole

## Normative vs. Positive Economics

-   **Positive Economics**: the study of how things are

    -   What are the effects of a carbon tax on gasoline consumption
    -   How do income taxes affect labour supply
    -   Primarily an empirical field
    -   Most research in public economics is positive economics

-   **Normative Economics**: the study of how things should be

    -   Should the government impose a carbon tax on gasoline?
    -   Should income taxes be progressive or flat?
    -   Key difference with positive economics is that it involves value judgements
    -   Primarily a theoretical field

## Some Current Research Topics in Public Economics

-   Public economics is a broad research field with significant overlap with other fields like Labour, Education, Health Economics

-   Some of the research paper titles from the most recent NBER Public Economics meeting:

    -   "Paternalistic Social Assistance: Evidence and Implications from Cash vs. In-Kind Transfers"
    -   "Health Impacts of Federal Pandemic Aid to State and Local Governments"
    -   "The Racial Penalty in Job Ladder Transitions"
    -   "Behavioral Responses to Estate Taxation: Evidence from Taiwan"
    -   "The Big Economic Consequences of Small Financial Shocks: Evidence from Minor Car Crashes"

# Canada's Government

## Introduction

-   In this section we discuss basics of Canada's public finance system

-   Broad overview, not comprehensive

-   We cover

    -   History

    -   Responsibilities of each level of government

## History

-   Tax and spending powers come from the **Constitution Act, 1982**

    -   Amends the British North America (BNA) Act, 1867
    -   Structure and powers of government are the same in both acts
    -   Constitution act adds elements like the Charter of Rights and Freedoms

-   Constitution act specifies federal and provincial responsibilities

    -   Federal: items that are common to all provinces
    -   Provincial: items that are specific to each province

-   Municipal responsibilities are not outlined in constitution

    -   They are delegated by the provinces

    -   Means lots of differences across provinces in the way municipalities operate

## Federal Government

-   Key areas of federal responsibility as outlined in the constitution:

    -   Direct and indirect taxation

    -   National defence

    -   Navigation and shipping (e.g marine shipping)

    -   Regulation of trade and commerce (e.g. trade disputes, tariffs)

    -   Criminal justice system

    -   Money and banking

    -   Census

    -   Citizenship

    -   Postal service

## Federal Government

-   The federal government raises revenue mainly through direct and indirect taxes

    -   **Direct tax**: paid by directly to the taxing authority that cannot be shifted to another entity

        -   e.g. income, estate, capital gains, property tax

    -   **Indirect tax**: paid indirectly through an intermediary that can pass it to another entity

        -   e.g. sales tax (HST/GST), tariff

## Federal Government

-   The federal government has broad taxing and spending powers

-   At the time of confederation, most revenue came from tariffs (customs duties)

-   Now the majority comes from personal and corporate income taxes and sales taxes

![Figure: Composition of Canadian Federal Revenues](images/ros55466_0103.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Provincial Government

-   Key areas of federal responsibility as outlined in the constitution:

    -   Direct taxation within the province (note: not indirect taxation)
    -   Prisons
    -   Hospitals
    -   Municipalities
    -   Education
    -   Natural resources
    -   Incorporation of companies

## Provincial Government

-   Provincial government can only levy direct taxes

    -   Mainly income and property tax
    -   Courts have defined retail sales taxes and excise taxes on tobacco and gasoline as direct taxes (for some reason)

-   At confederation, most revenue came from federal government transfers to provinces

    -   Very little from direct taxation

-   Now, taxes account for 50% of revenues

    = Rest is federal transfers, sales of goods and services, fines/fees, natural resources

# Size of Government

## Introduction

-   Politicians often quibble over the size of government

    -   Conservatives prefer smaller government
    -   Liberals tend to prefer larger government

-   There are different ways to measure its size

    -   Expenditures (total or as fraction of GDP)
    -   Revenues (total or as fraction of GDP)
    -   Government employment
    -   Number of regulations

-   Most common is to measure using **annual expenditures**

## Classification of Expenditures

-   Can classify government expenditures into three types

    1.  Purchases of goods and services

        -   Government buys many goods/services

        -   Examples: Military equipment, buildings, consulting services, professional training

    2.  Transfers of income to people, businesses, other governments

        -   Examples: HST rebate, Canada Pension Plan, Canada Child Benefit

    3.  Interest payments

        -   Government borrows to spend when revenues are insufficient

        -   Does this by issuing bonds

        -   Interest payments are due on that borrowing

  theme(text = element_text(size = 16))
```

## Difficulties Counting Expenditures

-   Some expenditures are not easy to count

-   Loan guarantees (e.g student loans) and contingent commitments (e.g CPP)

    -   Government is committed to spend at some point in the future

    -   Amounts of these commitments are not fully known

    -   Use accrual accounting to budget

-   Regulations

    -   Impose costs on individuals/businesses

    -   These costs do not appear in government budget

## Difficulties Counting Expenditures

-   Tax expenditure

    -   Indirect spending through reductions in taxes owing

    -   Examples: charitable giving tax credit, partial taxation of capital gains, zero rating groceries

    -   Not reflected in budget

-   Capital investments

    -   Capital goods (e.g. machines) are consumed slowly over time

    -   Typically large value in year they are purchased

    -   Gives mistaken impression of significant government involvement in economy

# Federal Government Budget

# Municipal, Territorial, Indigenous Governments

## Municipal, Territorial, Indigenous Governments


- Municipal governments

    - Rely heavily on property taxes, transfers from provincial governments
    - Spend mainly on local services (e.g. police, fire, roads, parks)
    
- Territorial governments

    - Powers delegated by federal government
    - Rely heavily on transfers from federal government
    - Spend on similar things to provincial governments

- Indigenous governments

    - Many governed by the Indian Act
    - Increasingly self-governing
    - Can raise some independent revenue
    
    
# Fiscal Transfers

## Introduction

- Federal government collects half of all government revenue

    - Spends only one third
    
- Provinces and municipalities collect other half government revenue

    - Spend two thirds
    
- Imbalance is addressed through **fiscal transfers**

    - Federal government transfers money to provinces and municipalities
    - Provinces also transfer money to municipalities
    
- Transfers can be conditional or unconditional

    - Conditional: must be spent on specific programs
    - Unconditional: can be spent on anything  
    
    
## Transfers and Constitutional Responsibilities

- Constitution Act outlines responsibilities of federal and provincial governments

- Conditional federal transfers do not violate constitution


  - Federal government not providing services directly
  - Provinces can choose to participate
  - Nevertheless controversial

- Noteworthy unconditional grant is **equalization**

  - Provides funds to provinces that have below average ability to raise revenue 
  - Formula has been a matter of debate for years
