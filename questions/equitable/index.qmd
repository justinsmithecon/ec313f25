## RTTWS Chapter 17 Problem 3

A study by Dahlby and Ferede (2015) provides estimates of the marginal excess burden or additional dollar of revenue in the Canadian provinces (in 2013). For Manitoba, it is 1.207 for the corporate income tax and 0.364 for the general sales tax. Based on these estimates, use the Ramsey rule to propose a direction for tax reform that would reduce the excess burden from taxation while maintaining revenue neutrality. Explain your reasoning.

## RTTWS Chapter 16 Problem 4

The demand for X is given by $X = 100 - 2P_x$, and its supply is perfectly elastic at $P_x = 14$. The demand for Y is given by $Y = 350 - 3P_y$, and its supply is perfectly elastic at $P_y = 18$. The government wishes to raise $10,000$ by imposing specific taxes $t_x$ on X and $t_y$ on Y. If it wishes to minimize the total ratio of taxes, $t_x/t_y$, according to the inverse elasticity rule, what should this ratio be?

## RTTWS Chapter 16 Problem 5

## RTTWS Chapter 16 Problem 5

Indicate which of the following statements is true, false, or uncertain, and explain why:
