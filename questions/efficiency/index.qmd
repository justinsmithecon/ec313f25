## RTTWS Chapter 15 Problem 2

Describe how the shape of an individual's indifference curve affects the magnitude of a tax's excess burden. What does this tell you about how the degree of substitutability between the taxed item and the other item matters for the efficiency of taxation?

## RTTWS Chapter 15 Problem 5

Which of the following is likely to impose a large excess burden?

a\) A tax on land

## 

## RTTWS Chapter 15 Problem 5

Which of the following is likely to impose a large excess burden?

b\) A subsidy on personal computers

## RTTWS Chapter 15 Problem 5

Which of the following is likely to impose a large excess burden?

c\) A tax of \$75 on smartphones

## RTTWS Chapter 15 Problem 5

Which of the following is likely to impose a large excess burden?

d\) A subsidy on investment in high tech companies?

## RTTWS Chapter 15 Problem 5

Which of the following is likely to impose a large excess burden?

e\) A 5% tex on bottled water

## RTTWS Chapter 15 Problem 5

Which of the following is likely to impose a large excess burden?

f\) A 10% tax on all computer software



## RTTWS Chapter 15 Problem 6

Suppose the market demand curve for beer is described by the equation $Q_d^b = 600 - 15P_b^d$ where ( $Q_d^b$ ) is the number of cases of beer and ( $P_b^d$ ) is the price per case. The supply curve is given by $Q_s^b = 10P_b^s$

a. Calculate the elasticities of demand and supply at the equilibrium quantity.

## RTTWS Chapter 15 Problem 6

b. Suppose the government introduces an excise tax of 15 percent per case of beer. Determine the excess burden of this tax using the formula found in footnote 7 and the elasticities found in part (a).

## RTTWS Chapter 15 Problem 6


c. Calculate the tax revenues and the average excess burden.


## RTTWS Chapter 15 Problem 11

Setting a price ceiling for a good below the market price results in an excess burden. Demonstrate this by using supply and demand curves. In addition, show how the imposition of a tax on a substitute good, by affecting the demand for the good with a price ceiling, increases the excess burden.
