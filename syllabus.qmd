## Course Description

This course examines the economics of taxation through both theoretical
and empirical lenses. Using tools from microeconomics and econometrics,
we analyze how different forms of taxation affect individual behavior,
economic efficiency, and the distribution of resources. The course
introduces key concepts in tax incidence, optimal taxation, pigouvian
taxes, and the trade-offs between equity and efficiency. Students will
engage with current research to understand how economists estimate the
behavioral and welfare effects of tax policy. They are also asked to
apply their knowledge to data based assignments. While the course is
centered on the Canadian tax system, the main concepts are applicable
more widely. By the end of the course, students will be equipped to
critically assess tax policy using the theoretical and empirical
techniques in public economics.

## Course Structure

### Lectures

The scheduling details of the course are as follows

| Section |      Time      | Location |
|:-------:|:--------------:|:--------:|
|    A    | TR 4:00-5:20pm |  LH2066  |

### Office Hours

I strongly encourage you to come to office hours if you need
clarification about anything in the course.  Students are often nervous
or intimidated at the idea of one-one-one discussions with their
instructor.  Don’t be.  It’s a casual discussion where I will answer
whatever questions you have without any judgement.

Office hours are remote only, unless you really wish to meet in
person. [Please sign up for a time
here](https://outlook.office.com/book/BookaTimewithDrJustinSmith@wlu.ca/?ismsaljsauthenabled).
Timeslots are 15-mins each, and you can book up to two for each office
hours session depending on how much you need to discuss. When you book,
the system will automatically enter a time into my calendar, and it will
stay there unless you cancel. It also produces reminder emails to make
sure neither of us forgets.

## Course Material

### Textbook

The required textbook for the course is

Rosen, Harvey S., and Lindsay M. Tedds, and Trevor Tombe, and
Jean-Francois Wen, and Tracy Snoddon. *Public Finance in Canada.* 6th
Canadian edition. McGraw-Hill Ryerson, 2023.

This book is available in various locations, including but not limited
to the Laurier Bookstore, Amazon, and direct fom the publisher, McGraw
Hill. Here are the approximate prices you can expect

| Source        | Book Type              | Price |
|:--------------|:-----------------------|:------|
| WLU Bookstore | Physical, Paperback    | TBD   |
| Amazon        | Physical, Paperback    | \$157 |
| McGraw Hill   | Physical, Paperback    | \$129 |
| McGraw Hill   | Online, 180 Day Rental | \$69  |
| McGraw Hill   | Online, Lifetime       | \$99  |

Make sure to buy the book on its own, and not the version that comes
bundled with Connect, as we will not use Connect in this course

### Software

The assignments will ask you to manipulate data with the statistical
software Stata. The university has a site licence for this software,
which you can access from the in-person or virtual computer labs. To
access the virtual labs, follow the instructions outlined here

<https://students.wlu.ca/services-and-spaces/tech-services/computers-and-equipment/virtual-computer-labs.html>

If you would like to purchase a copy of Stata for home use (not
required), there are various options you can explore here:
<https://www.stata.com/order/dl/>. The cheapest option is student
license for Stata/BE, which costs USD 49.

### Course GPT

I have created a GPT specific to this course that you can use if you
wish, [linked
](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-685c539cef888191b373a9a5601bcdef-ec306)[here](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-68b1ee87edec81918d2084bfa05b56cc-ec313).
While my opinion is that the best way to succeed in this course is to
engage with the lectures, lecture notes, textbook, and to ask questions
in office hours, I recognize that people will use AI. To make the AI
experience as closely linked to EC313 as possible, I have trained a GPT
on some of the course materials.

You are permitted to use generative AI for your assignments. In all
submissions in which you use generative AI, you must [cite its
usage](#0). Failing to cite the use of generative AI is a form of
academic misconduct and [Senate Policy 12.2 Student Code of Conduct:
Academic Misconduct](#0) will be applied. Treat the AI as you would any
other source, meaning that you cannot directly copy and paste AI output
into your assignments.

**Use this tool with caution.** As we all know, generative AI does not
always produce reliable output, and as such you may get wrong answers to
your questions even though it is trained on the course material.

## Evaluation

You will be evaluated on two equally weighted assignments, one midterm,
and one final exam. The weights and due dates for each assessment are as
follows:

| Assessment   | Due Date                             | Weight |
|:-------------|:-------------------------------------|:-------|
| Assignment 1 | Friday, October 3, 2025 at 9:00pm    | 5%     |
| Assignment 2 | Friday, November 21, 2025 at 9:00pm  | 5%     |
| Midterm      | Thursday, October 30, 2025, in class | 40%    |
| Final Exam   | TBA                                  | 50%    |

Assignments will ask you to manipulate and interpret data, and answer
some short answer or mathematical questions. Instructions will be posted
to MyLearningSpace one week prior to the due date.

Both the midterm and final exam will be in person. The midterm will take
place in the classroom where the lectures take place at the scheduled
lecture time. The final exam schedule is posted roughly half way through
the term.

In the past I have placed more weight on the assignments and less weight
on the in-person exams, but the pervasive use of generative AI has made
it impossible to verify that assessments done outside of the classroom
were actually completed by the student. So while take-home assignments
are still part of the course, they do not constitute a large proportion
of the grade.

## Topics

Below is a list of tentative topics covered in the course. I may add or
remove items depending on how quickly the course proceeds. A reading
list for each topic is available at the end of this syllabus.

| Topic                                  | Readings         |

| Taxation and Efficiency                | RTTWS Chapter 15 |
| Efficient and Equitable Taxation       | RTTWS Chapter 16 |
| The Personal Income Tax                | RTTWS Chapter 17 |

## Missed Midterms

Students who miss a midterm will be given deferred midterm for the
following reasons:

1)  [Religious conflict]{.underline}: If you have a religious commitment
    that interferes with the midterm exam, fill out the [Student Request
    for Accommodation for Religious Observances
    form](https://web.wlu.ca/accommodations/) **within two weeks of the
    start of the first day of classes**.

2)  [Course conflict]{.underline}: If your midterm overlaps with another
    scheduled course, file a petition with the [Lazaridis School
    Petitions
    Coordinator](https://wlu.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_88MrVTvGZlg6phk)
    **within two weeks of the start of the first day of classes**.

3)  [Varsity Sports]{.underline}: If a varsity sporting event interferes
    with the midterm, file a petition with the [Lazaridis School
    Petitions
    Coordinator](https://wlu.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_88MrVTvGZlg6phk)
    and contact the Department of Athletics **within two weeks of the
    start of the first day of classes**. Note that this policy applies
    only to *varsity* sports; students who have non-varsity sports
    conflicts are not eligible for a deferred midterm

Students who miss a midterm and have an acceptable medical or
compassionate reason will have the weight of the midterm transferred to
the final exam. In the case of medical reasons, I require that students
complete the [Absence for Medical Reasons Self-Declaration
Form](https://web.wlu.ca/illness/). Note that no medical notes are
required or requested.

In all other circumstances, students who miss a midterm will receive a
grade of zero on the test.

## Late Assignments

Late assignments and quizzes for religious conflicts, course conflicts,
or medical/compassionate reasons as defined above will be given
reasonable accommodation. In all other circumstances, students who
submit late assignments or quizzes will receive a grade of zero.

## Deferred Final Examinations

Students who miss a final examination should follow the [university
policy on deferred final
exams](https://students.wlu.ca/academics/exams/deferred-exams.html). As
noted in the policy, deferred exams may be granted for legitimate
documentable reasons only, such as illness, religious reasons,
extraordinary personal or family circumstances, a scheduling conflict
with another exam or 3 exams within 24 hours. Deferred exams are not
granted for travel or vacation during the final exam period, commuting,
or for more study time. For religious accommodations, fill out the
[student request for accommodation for religious observances
form](https://web.wlu.ca/accommodations/) **within 7 calendar days
before the final day of classes for the term**. For other reasons,
submit a petition to the [Lazaridis School Petitions
Coordinator](https://wlu.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_88MrVTvGZlg6phk)
within **3 business days after the scheduled date of the exam**.
