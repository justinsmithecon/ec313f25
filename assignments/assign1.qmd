## Description

In this assignment you are asked to manipulate data, estimate statistical relationships, and interpret the findings. The questions are based on the relationship between cigarette taxes and cigarette prices in the US, to check whether and by how much taxes are passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.  The assignment is designed to give you practice with data analysis in Stata, and to help you understand how economists use data to answer questions about economic behavior.

## Instructions

### Questions

The document below contains the assignment questions. Please provide all answers in the space below each question.  If the question requires any Stata code, please include the code relevant to that question in the space provided.  Also include the relevant output.  Note: output must be reformatted into a professional-looking table or figure.  Do not simply copy and paste (or screenshot) the Stata output.

When you save the file to your computer, please rename it with your family name and student number, with no spaces.

### Data analysis

The data come from the Tax Burden on Tobacco dataset created by Orzechowski and Walker, and downloaded from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) .  It contains data on cigarette prices, taxes, sales, and revenues for each of the 50 US states from 1970 to 2019.  Note that the data are a panel (repeated observations on each state over time) and have been set as a panel (using **xtset**) with $state_abbr$ as the panel variable and $year$ as the year variable in Stata.  This means you can use the set of **xt** commands in Stata to analyze the data.


The data file is linked below.

### Submission

When you are finished, you are required to submit three documents according to the following instructions:

-   Your .do and .log file. **Submit this in MyLearningSpace only.**
-   A rendered PDF of your answers to the questions. **Submit this in both MyLearningSpace and Gradescope.**

### Plagiarism

This is an independent assignment, which I expect you to complete on your own. It is plagiarism to copy someone else's work verbatim, which includes Stata code. Any work you submit should be yours only. However, you are encouraged to talk to each other to try to figure out how to do the assignment.
